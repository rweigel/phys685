A note on grading. On problems where I have you build towards a solution, I have noticed that some students take the path of omitting justifications for key (and highly non-obvious) steps. When grading, I'm looking for evidence that you understand things. And if you write the problem statement, one intermediate equation and then the solution, I can't tell what you understand. If you don't know why a step is needed, say so or ask, otherwise, it often seems that you are trying to hoodwink me. The motivation for giving an answer to some problems is so that you can figure out the intermediate justifications, many of which are non-trivial.

In the solutions, steps that were frequently not addressed in student solutions are indicated by !!! in my solution.

Grading: Blue text is a comment. Red text or a red circle around blue text means points were taken off (this happens when I forget to switch pens).  Often I'll mark something wrong on your HW without explanation - I generally put the explanation for common errors in the solutions rather than writing the same comments many times. If my solutions do not clarify things, feel free to ask me a question.


Note that I will not post solutions to these problems until everyone has turned them in (due to illness,  this may be after the end of the semester). Also, I won't provide details on why I have marked parts of your solution is wrong. If you would like to discuss the solutions, feel free to meet with me during office hours or schedule an appointment.

You may not communicate with anyone else on these problems. You may look at references online, but do not post your problem to a forum or ask anyone for help.

# Continuous Charge Distributions 

A square non-conducting sheet of charge with side length $w$ has a uniform charge density of $\sigma_o$, lies in the $x-y$ plane, and is centered on the origin.

1. Find an integral or integrals that must be evaluated to find $\mathbf{E}(z)$, the electric field on the $z$-axis.
1. Evaluate the integral or integrals and show that for $z/w\ll 1$, $\mathbf{E}(z)$ reduces to the equation for an infinite non-conducting sheet of charge.

There are several ways to solve this problem. On can first find the field for a line of charge with a charge density of $\lambda$ and length $w$ that lies on the $x$-axis and is centered on the origin - the result is (see Griffiths 4th Edition example 2.2):

$$\mathbf{E}(z)=\frac{k\lambda w}{z\sqrt{z^2+w^2/4}}\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

Then integrate the field due to differential lines of charges. One needs to account for the fact that the $z$ in this equation will not be the same as the $z$ in this problem. If the differential lines of charge are in the $x$-$y$ plane and lie on the line $x=x'$, then replace the $z$ with $z^2+x'^2$ and use $\lambda = \sigma_odx'$, You can check your answer for this approach by using the result of the following approach after integration with respect to $x'$. 

$$\mathbf{E}_{dq'}(x,y,z) = \frac{dq'}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{\hat{\bf\char"0509}}{\char"0509^2}$$

A second approach requires two integrations. Start with

$$\mathbf{E}_{dq'}(x,y,z) = \frac{dq'}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{\hat{\bf\char"0509}}{\char"0509^2}$$

which expands to

$$\mathbf{E}_{dq'}(x,y,z) =\frac{dq'}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|^3}$$

(A third approach is to find the potential $\Psi_{dq'}(x,y,z) = dq'/(4\pi\epsilon_0\char"0509)$ and then use $\mathbf{E}=-\nabla \Psi$.)

and the general definitions

$$\mathbf{r}=x\hat{\mathbf{x}}+y\hat{\mathbf{y}}+z\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

$$\mathbf{r}'=x'\hat{\mathbf{x}}+y'\hat{\mathbf{y}}+z'\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

In this problem, $z'=0$ because all charges are in the $x-y$ plane. Using $dq' = \sigma_odx'dy'$, gives

$$\mathbf{E}(x,y,z) = \int_{-w/2}^{w/2}\int_{-w/2}^{w/2}\frac{ \sigma_odx'dy'}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{(x-x')\hat{\mathbf{x}}+(y-y')\hat{\mathbf{y}}+z\hat{\mathbf{z}}}{\big((x-x')^2+(y-y')^2+z^2\big)^{3/2}}$$

$\mathbf{E}(z)$ is obtained by setting $x=y=0$:

$$\mathbf{E}(z) = \int_{-w/2}^{w/2}\int_{-w/2}^{w/2}\frac{ \sigma_odx'dy'}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{-x'\hat{\mathbf{x}}+-y'\hat{\mathbf{y}}+z\hat{\mathbf{z}}}{\big(x'^2+y'^2+z^2\big)^{3/2}}$$

The $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{y}}$ integrals are zero because their integrands are odd functions. Many students argued they are zero "by symmetry". The word "symmetry" is too general because there are many types of symmetry. It is better to state what kind of symmetry: consider differential charges at $(x,y)$ and $(-x,-y)$ - their horizontal electric fields exactly cancel (ideally provide a diagram). The sheet of charge can be constructed by placing charges with canceling horizontal components and so the horizontal electric field is zero.

To simplify the integration for the $\hat{\mathbf{y}}$ term, define

$$I = \int_{-w/2}^{w/2}dy'\int_{-w/2}^{w/2}\frac{dx'}{(x'^2+a^2)^{3/2}}$$

where $a^2\equiv y'^2+z^2$ and then $E_z(z)=k\sigma_ozI$. This integral can be looked up or found using Mathematica or Wolfram Alpha. Some students reported "computation time exceeded" with Wolfram Alpha. This was probably caused by entering the double integral instead of doing a single integral at a time.

Integration with respect to $x'$ gives

$$I= \int_{-w/2}^{w/2}dy'\frac{x'}{a^2(x'^2+a^2)^{1/2}}\Bigg|_{-w/2}^{w/2}=\int_{-w/2}^{w/2}dy'\frac{w}{a^2(a^2+w^2/4)^{1/2}}$$

Using the earlier definition $a^2\equiv y'^2+z^2$ and a new definition $b^2\equiv z^2+w^2/4$ gives

$$I=\int_{-w/2}^{w/2}\frac{wdy'}{(y'^2+z^2)\sqrt{y'^2+b^2}}$$

This integral can be looked up and the result is (using $\tan^{-1}(u)=-\tan^{-1}(u)$)

$$I=\frac{4}{z}\tan^{-1}\left[\frac{w^2}{4z}\frac{1}{\sqrt{z^2+w^2/2}}\right]$$

The final result, using $E_z(z)=k\sigma_ozI$ defined earlier, is 

$$E_z(z)=\frac{\sigma_o}{\pi \epsilon_o}\tan^{-1}\left[\frac{w^2}{4z}\frac{1}{\sqrt{z^2+w^2/2}}\right]$$

For $z\ll w$, the argument to the inverse tangent is

$$\frac{w^2}{4z}\frac{1}{\sqrt{z^2+w^2/2}}\simeq \frac{w}{z}\frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}$$

so for $z \gt 0$ and $z\ll w$

$$E_z(z)\rightarrow\frac{\sigma_o}{\pi\epsilon_o}\tan^{-1}(+\infty) = \frac{\sigma_o}{2\epsilon_o}$$

For $z \lt 0$ and $z\ll w$

$$E_z(z)\rightarrow\frac{\sigma_o}{\pi\epsilon_o}\tan^{-1}(-\infty) = -\frac{\sigma_o}{2\epsilon_o}$$

and so the solution matches that for an infinite sheet of charge. Another problem one could ask is to show that for $z\gg w$, $E_z\rightarrow k\sigma_ow^2/z^2$ (far away, the sheet of charge appears as a charge $\sigma_ow^2$ at the origin). To show this, one would need to Taylor series expand the argument of the inverse tangent for small $w/z$.

## Representing $\rho$ Using $\delta$ and $\Theta$ 

1. Find the volume charge density $\rho$ in cylindrical coordinates in terms of $\delta$ and/or $\Theta$ for an infinitely long cylinder of radius $b$ with a charge density per unit length of $\lambda_o$ uniformly distributed on its surface. Assume that the cylinder's centerline is along the $z$-axis.
1. Repeat 1. assuming the cylinder is finite and extends from $z=-h/2$ to $z=h/2$.

''Optional''

3. Find the volume charge density $\rho$ in cylindrical coordinates in terms of $\delta$ and/or $\Theta$ for a uniformly charged disk of radius $b$ with charge density $\sigma_o$ that lies in the $x-y$ plane and is centered on the origin. Use $s$ for the radial coordinate in cylindrical coordinates.

4. Use identity 5. on page 26 of Jackson to convert this to spherical coordinates. Use $r$ for the radial coordinate in spherical coordinates.

1. $\rho = \frac{\lambda_o}{2\pi b}\delta(b-s)$

2. $\rho=\frac{\lambda_o}{2\pi b}\delta(b-s)\Big[\Theta(z+{h}/{2})-\Theta(z-{h}/{2})\Big]$

Some students assumed the charge was on the surface of the cylinder. In this case, the solution is

1. $\rho=\frac{\lambda_o}{\pi b^2}\Theta(b-s)$

2. $\rho=\frac{\lambda_o}{\pi b^2}\Theta(b-s)\Big[\Theta(z+{h}/{2})-\Theta(z-{h}/{2})\Big]$

----

3. $\rho=\frac{Q}{\pi b^2}\delta(z)\Theta(b-s)$

4. $\rho = \frac{Q}{\pi b^2}\frac{\delta(\theta-\pi/2)}{r}\Theta(b-r)$

## Gauss' Law 

1.## Infinite Line of Charge 

In general, in cylindrical coordinates, the electric field has the form

$$\mathbf{E}(s,\phi,z)=E_s(s,\phi,z)\hat{\mathbf{s}}+E_{\phi}(s,\phi,z)\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}+E_z(s,\phi,z)\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

where $s$ is the radial coordinate in cylindrical coordinates.

Consider an infinite line of charge with a uniform charge per unit length of $\lambda_o$ on the $z$-axis. The typical approach to finding that the equation for the electric field is

$$\mathbf{E}(s)=\frac{\lambda_o}{2\pi\epsilon_o}\frac{\hat{\mathbf{s}}}{s}$$

is to use a cylindrical Gaussian surface and Gauss' law. When using Gauss' law, one must make arguments for why

1. $E_s$ does not depend on $\phi$ and $z$

2. $E_z=0$

With these two justifications and Gauss' law, one arrives at only an equation for the radial component of the electric field, $E_s$. To complete the solution, one also needs to provide an argument for why 

3. $E_{\phi}=0$.

Derive the equation given above for the electric field using Gauss' law and explicitly state arguments for 1.-3.

I gave this problem because I have come to realize that students can use Gauss' law to find the electric field, but can't often answer conceptual questions about justifications for the steps needed to get the solution. The problem is that most textbooks don't emphasize the arguments or provide follow-up questions to test their understanding of the arguments and so students don't think too deeply about them.

Understanding the reasoning for this problem is critical for understanding the boundary condition equations

$$(\mathbf{E}_2-\mathbf{E}_1)\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} = \mathbf{E}_{2\perp}-\mathbf{E}_{1\perp} = \left[-\frac{\partial \Psi_2}{\partial n}+\frac{\partial \Psi_1}{\partial n}\right]_{n=0}=\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_o}$$

$$\mathbf{E}_{2\parallel}-\mathbf{E}_{2\parallel}=(\mathbf{E}_2-\mathbf{E}_1)\cdot \hat{\mathbf{t}}=0$$

where $n$ is the coordinate that is perpendicular to the boundary surface and outward to the volume enclosed by the boundary surface; $t$ is any coordinate parallel to the surface.

Several students used the solution for $\mathbf{E}$ given for arguments 1.-3., but this is circular reasoning. The point of the problem is to justify all of the steps needed to get to the solution.

I did not expect a solution with the level of detail in what follows. I generally looked for arguments or words that seemed close to something said below. I did not write extended comments on your solutions for statements that were wrong - you should be able to determine what was wrong by reading the following solution.

1. $E_s$ does not depend on $z$ because the charge distribution does not change if we shift the origin of $z$. Said another way, two people who solve this problem using a different location for $z=0$ should get the same result. $E_s$ does not depend on $\phi$ because if we rotate the charge distribution around the $z$-axis by $\phi$, the charge distribution does not change. Said another way, two people who solve the problem using a different $\phi=0$ line perpendicular to the line of charge should get the same answer. The same argument can be used to argue that $E_z$ and $E_{\phi}$ do not depend on $\phi$ and $z$, but this is not needed because in 2. and 3. they are found to be zero.

2. $E_z=0$ - Assume the line extends from $z=\pm L$. Adding the electric field due to a differential charge at $z$ to that from a differential charge at $-z$ gives an electric field that points in the $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ direction in the $x-y$ plane. An infinite line of charge can be created by letting $L\rightarrow\infty$. Or, for very small $s$, in the $x-y$ plane the line of charge appears infinite.

3. $E_{\phi}=0$ by the same argument as 2.

'''Detailed solution using 1.-3. and Gauss' law'''

$$\mathbf{E}(s,\phi,z)=E_s(s,\phi,z)\hat{\mathbf{s}}+E_{\phi}(s,\phi,z)\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}+E_z(s,\phi,z)\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

A Gaussian cylinder of radius $s$ and a height $h$ and centerline along the $z$-axis has three surfaces, with normals of $\hat{\mathbf{z}}$ on the top cap, $-\hat{\mathbf{z}}$ on the bottom cap, and $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ on the curved side.

$$\oint \mathbf{E}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}da = \int_{top\thinspacecap} \mathbf{E}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{z}} da +  \int_{bottom\thinspacecap} \mathbf{E}\cdot (-\hat{\mathbf{z}}) da + \int_{side}\mathbf{E}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} da$$

$\mathbf{E}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{z}} = E_z(s,\phi,z)$ and we have argued that $E_z=0$, so the first two integrals are zero.

$\mathbf{E}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} = E_s(s,\phi,z)$, so the last integral is, using $da=sdzd\phi$,

$$\int_{side}\mathbf{E}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} da = \int_{z=-h/2}^{h/2}\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi} E_s(s,\phi,z) sdz\thinspace d\phi$$

Because $E_s$ is independent of $z$, we can write

$$\int_{z=-h/2}^{h/2}\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi} E_s(s,\phi,z) sdz\thinspace d\phi=\int_{z=-h/2}^{h/2}\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi} E_s(s,\phi) sdz\thinspace d\phi=h\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi} E_s(s,\phi) sd\phi$$

Because $E_s$ is independent of $\phi$, we can write

$$h\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi} E_s(s,\phi) sd\phi=h\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi} E_s(s) sd\phi$$

Because $s$ and $\phi$ are orthogonal,

$$h\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi} E_s(s) sd\phi=hE_s(s) s\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi} d\phi=hE_s(s) s2\pi$$

Note that Gauss' law only gave us $E_s$ - we had to argue why $E_{\phi}$ and $E_z$ were zero. In addition, in order to do the integration in Gauss' law, we needed to provide additional justification for why $E_s$ could only depend on $s$. So this Gauss' law problem had two separate components: 1. arguments that reduce and simplify the general solution

$$\mathbf{E}(s,\phi,z)=E_s(s,\phi,z)\hat{\mathbf{s}}+E_{\phi}(s,\phi,z)\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}+E_z(s,\phi,z)\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

and then 2. evaluation of the integral in Gauss' law. I find that students that don't understand 1. are not able to articulate why a given Gaussian surface can't be used to find the electric field. For example, their answer to why a Gaussian sphere could not be used to find the electric field in this problem typically only involves an ambiguous statement about symmetry; "symmetry" is ambiguous because both a Gaussian sphere and a Gaussian cylinder have symmetry).

1.## Thin Cylinder of Charge 

Use Gauss' law and other arguments to find the electric field for an infinitely long cylinder of radius $b$ with a charge per unit length of $\lambda_o$ on its surface and its centerline along the $z$-axis. As in the previous problem, state all arguments needed to arrive at the final equation.

{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! align="left" |&nbsp;Solution
|-
|
1. Same argument as the previous problem.

2. Assume the cylinder is created by placing infinite lines of charge parallel to the $z$-axis on the surface of a cylinder. One can use a diagram to show that at an arbitrary point in space, either inside or outside of the cylinder, one can find two lines of charge which have an electric field that sums to give an electric field that points in the $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ direction.  A diagram should be given to show this.

3. $E_{\phi}=0$ by the same argument as 2.

A common error is to note that Gauss' law with a Gaussian cylinder with radius less than $b$ has no charge enclosed, so

$$\oint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{a} = 0 \Rightarrow \mathbf{E}=0$$

inside the cylinder. The fact that the integral of a vector is zero does not imply the vector is zero. And without additional words, I can't tell if you understand that. The above claim is equivalent to the statement

$$\int f(x)\thinspace dx = 0 \Rightarrow f(x)=0$$

A better solution is to state that from 1.-3., we know $\mathbf{E}=E_s(s)\hat{\mathbf{s}}$. Using $d\mathbf{a}=\mathbf{\hat{s}}sdz\thinspace d\phi$ gives

$$\oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = 0 + 0 + \int_{side} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} =  \int_{side} E_s(s)\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}sd\phi=2\pi h s E_s(s)$$

where the two zero terms are due to the fact that we have argued $\mathbf{E}=E_s(s)\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ and so the dot product of this with the normal direction on the top and bottom caps is zero (see solution for the line of charge for full details).

For $s\lt b$, $\oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a}$ is zero, so for $s\ne 0$, $E_s(s)=0$. Gauss' law does not provide an answer for $s=0$ because we get $E_s=0/0$, but one can argue using pairs of lines of charge that the radial field must be zero for $s=0$. It is interesting to note that there is a purely geometrical approach to showing that the radial field is zero inside the cylinder. It is similar to the approach Newton used to show that the net force inside of a shell of mass is zero (he did not use calculus!).

To find $E_s$ outside of the cylinder, use

$$2\pi h s E_s(s) = \frac{Q_{encl}}{\epsilon_o} = \frac{\lambda_o h}{\epsilon_o}$$

# Lecture Follow-Up Questions 

An uncharged conducting sphere of radius $2b$ is centered on the origin and has a spherical cavity of radius $b$ that is also centered on the origin.

1. If a charge of $+q$ is at the origin, explain why the surfaces at $r=2b$ and $r=b$ each have a net charge of $+q$ and $-q$, respectively, and not, say, $+q/2$ and $-q/2$.
1. Repeat this question for the case where the inner surface of the cavity is not spherical (but the charge at the origin is still in a cavity)

{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! align="left" |&nbsp;Answer

Several students used the justification of "E is zero inside a conductor". This is not a full justification. If someone said "$+q/2$ and $-q/2$ give E of zero inside the conductor", your proof that this statement is wrong would require using Gauss' law.

1.

Gauss' law using a sphere of radius $b\lt r\lt 2b$:

$$\oint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{a} = \frac{Q_{encl}}{\epsilon_o} = \frac{q + q_{r=b}}{\epsilon_o}$$

LHS is zero because field is zero inside conductor. So $q_{r=b}=-q$.

2. 

Same approach but the surface is not a sphere but rather a surface that is always inside conductor; $q_{r=b}=-q$.

# Method of Images Review 

Consider the problem of finding the potential $\Phi(\mathbf{x})$ above a grounded and infinite conducting plane when a point charge $q$ is placed above it. (Recall that $\Phi(\mathbf{x})$ is short-hand for $\Phi(x,y,z)$.) 

Assume the conducting plane is in the $x$-$y$ plane and the charge $q$ is placed at at $(x,y,z)=(0,0,z_o)$ 

Due to the point charges, a surface charge density will appear on the conducting plane. To calculate $\Phi(\mathbf{x})$, one needs to know this surface charge density. However, we can't use the direct integration formula used for continuous charge distributions

$$\Phi(\mathbf{x})= \Phi_q(\mathbf{x}) + \int_{plane}\frac{k\thinspace\sigma(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}\thinspace da'$$

because we don't know $\sigma$. ($\Phi_q(\mathbf{x})$ is the potential due to the point charge $q$).

To find $\Phi(\mathbf{x})$, one finds the potential due to a alternantive charge configuration: a point charge $q$ at $(x,y,z) = (0,0,z_o)$ and a point charge $-q$ at $(x,y,z) = (0,0,-z_o)$.

1. Find $\Phi(x,y,z)$ for the alternative charge configuration.
1. Explain why this $\Phi(\mathbf{x})$ is the solution to the original problem.
1. Compute $\partial \Phi(x,y,z)/\partial z$ when $z=0$.

{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! align="left" |&nbsp;Answer
|-
|
2. From 1.9 of Jackson, if a potential satisfies Poisson's equation in a volume and Dirichlet boundary conditions on the enclosing surface, then it is a unique solution. 

Here the surface is the $z=0$ plane and a hemispherical surface of a large radius above this plane.

Both the original and alternative charge configuration satisfy the same Poisson's equation. In the first case,

$$\nabla^2\Phi=-q\delta(\mathbf{r}-z_o\hat{\mathbf{z}})$$

in the alternative case,

$$\nabla^2\Phi=-q\delta(\mathbf{r}-z_o\hat{\mathbf{z}})+q\delta(\mathbf{r}+z_o\hat{\mathbf{z}})$$

However, because the volume is for $z\gt 0$, the second delta term is zero and so the potential for the alternative case satisfies the same Poisson equation as the original problem.

The potential for the alternative charge configuration satisfies the boundary conditions $\Phi(x,y,0)=0$ and $\Phi=0$ on a half-sphere of large radius. Because solutions to Poisson's equation in a volume bounded by a surface with given boundary conditions are unique, the potential to the alternative problem is the solution for the original problem.

# Point Charge above Infinite Plane 

A point charge $q$ is at a distance $d$ above an infinite and grounded conducting plane. Use the method of images to find:

1. the potential $\Psi(\mathbf{r})$ in the region above the plane;
1. $\nabla^2\Psi$ in the region above the plane;
1. the surface charge density induced on the plane (also verify that this surface charge density gives the expected potential if $\Psi(\mathbf{x})=(1/4\pi\epsilon_0)\int dq/|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'}|$ is used to compute the potential);
1. the force between the plane and the charge using Coulomb's law for the force between $q$ and its image $q'$;
1. the total force acting on the plane by integrating $\sigma^2/2\epsilon_0$ over the whole plane;
1. the work necessary to remove the charge $q$ from its position to infinity;

1. the work necessary to remove the charge $q$ from its position to infinity;
1. the potential energy between the charge $q$ and its image (compare the answer the work computed in the previous part and discuss).

1.

$$\Psi = \frac{kq}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+(z-d)^2}}-\frac{kq}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+(z+d)^2}}$$

Justification given in previous problem.

2. 

Using the fact that

$$\nabla^2\left[\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}\right] = -4\pi\delta(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}')$$

gives

$$\nabla^2\Psi=-q\delta(x)\delta(y)\delta(z-d)+q\delta(x)\delta(y)\delta(z+d)$$

For $z\gt 0$, $\delta(z+d)=0$, so

$$\nabla^2\Psi=-q\delta(x)\delta(y)\delta(z-d)$$

Many students computed $\nabla^2\Psi$ and found it to be zero. This is not necessary as we know that the potential $\Psi(\mathbf{x})$ for a point charge at $\mathbf{x}'$, $\nabla^2\Psi = 0$ except at $\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{x}'$. At $\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{x}'$, $\nabla^2\Psi=0/0$ and the resolution of this indeterminacy using the delta function was explored in an earlier homework by modeling a point charge as a sphere of uniform charge density and a vanishing radius.

3. 

At the surface of a conductor, from Gauss' law,

$$\sigma=\epsilon_o\mathbf{E}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}$$

where $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ is the normal to the surface and $\mathbf{E}$ is the field on the surface. For the plane, $\hat{\mathbf{n}}= \hat{\mathbf{z}}$, so

$$\mathbf{E}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}=-(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\Psi)\cdot\hat{\mathbf{z}}=-\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial z}$$

$$\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial z}=\frac{-(z-d)kq}{(x^2+y^2+(z-d)^2)^{3/2}}-\frac{-(z+d)kq}{(x^2+y^2+(z-d)^2)^{3/2}}=\frac{2dkq}{(x^2+y^2+(z-d)^2)^{3/2}}$$

At the surface, $z=0$, so

$$\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial z}\Bigg|_{z=0}=\frac{2kqd}{(x^2+y^2+d^2)^{3/2}}$$

giving

$$\sigma=-\frac{q}{2\pi}\frac{d}{(x^2+y^2+d^2)^{3/2}}$$

Using

$$\Psi(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\int \frac{dq}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'}|}$$ 

with $dq=\sigma dx'dy'$ and $|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'}|=\sqrt{(x-x')^2+(y-y')^2+z^2}$ gives the required integral to find the potential due to the surface charges:

$$\Psi(x,y,z)=-\frac{qd}{8\pi\epsilon_0}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dx'dy'\frac{1}{((x-x')^2+(y-y')^2+z^2)^{1/2}}\frac{1}{(x'^2+y'^2+d^2)^{3/2}}$$

As mentioned on Piazza, we have not covered the technique for finding $\Psi(\mathbf{x}$, so find the potential for $z=0$ only, set $x=y=0$, giving

$$\Psi(0,0,z)=-\frac{qd}{8\pi\epsilon_0}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dx'dy'\frac{1}{(x'^2+y'^2+z^2)^{1/2}}\frac{1}{(x'^2+y'^2+d^2)^{3/2}}$$

Using polar coordinates with $s'^2=x'^2+y'^2$,

$$\Psi(z)=-\frac{qd}{8\pi\epsilon_0}\int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{0}^{2\pi}s'ds'd\phi'\frac{1}{(s'^2+z^2)^{1/2}}\frac{1}{(s'^2+d^2)^{3/2}}$$

Integration over $\phi'$ gives

$$\Psi(z)=-\frac{qd}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\int_{0}^{\infty}s'ds'\frac{1}{(s'^2+z^2)^{1/2}}\frac{1}{(s'^2+d^2)^{3/2}}$$

Using $u^2=s'^2+z^2$ gives

$$\Psi(z)=-\frac{qd}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\int_{z}^{\infty}u\thinspace du'\frac{1}{(u^2)^{1/2}}\frac{1}{(u^2-z^2+d^2)^{3/2}}$$

$$\Psi(z)=-\frac{qd}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\int_{z}^{\infty}\text{sign}(u)\thinspace du'\frac{1}{(u^2-z^2+d^2)^{3/2}}$$

where $\text{sign}(u)=u/|u|$. Using an integral table, $\int du(u^2+c^2)^{-3/2}= u/(c^2 \sqrt{c^2 + u^2})$ with $c^2\equiv d^2-z^2$ gives, for both signs of $z$,

$$\Psi(z)=-\frac{qd}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\left[\frac{1}{d^2-z^2}-\frac{|z|}{|d|(d^2-z^2)}\right]$$

Most students did not have absolute value signs in their solution because they did not use $\sqrt{z^2}=|z|$. Getting the absolute value in the answer below requires consideration of $z\gt 0$ and $z\lt 0$ cases in the above (in general, this would matter, but it does not matter for this problem because we are considering only $z\gt 0$). Using this fact and the fact that $d\gt 0$ by definition, so $|d|=d$, gives

$$\Psi(z)=-\frac{qd}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{1}{|z|+d}$$

This is the potential for the charges on the surface above and below the surface; it is symmetric around $z=0$ as expected. For $z\gt 0$, $|z|+d=|z+d|$, so we have recovered the second term in the potential for part 1. When $z \lt 0$, this potential is equal and opposite to the potential for the point charge above the plane, giving a zero potential for $z\lt 0$.

4.

The force is

$$F=\frac{kq}{(2d)^2}$$

5.

Integration should give the same force as 4.

6.

The downward force as a function of the position of the charge above the plane is

$$F=\frac{kq^2}{(2z)^2}$$

Integrating this force

$$W_{ext}= \int\mathbf{F}_{ext}\cdot d\mathbf{l} = \int_{z=d}^{\infty}\frac{kq^2dz}{(2z)^2}=\frac{kq}{4d}$$

Note that one should get a positive answer for the work required to remove the charge - the external force on the charge $q$ is in the same direction of its movement.

7. The potential energy of $q$ and its image is

$$U=-\frac{kq^2}{2d}$$

which corresponds to minus the work required to move charge $q$ out with $q'$ fixed: $\Delta U = U_f-U_i = 0 - U_i = W_{ext}$.

The discrepancy is due to the fact that in part 7., we assumed that the image charge (or equivalently, the induced charges on the plane) was fixed. As $q$ is moved upwards, the induced charge on the sheet decreases and so the force on $q$ due to the induced charges will be less than that assumed in 7.  To see that the force implied by use of 7. is 2x that in 6., compute the force using $dU/dz$ with $U$ from 7.: $U=-kq^2/(2z)$.

Another way at arriving at the same result as 6. is to consider $\int E^2 d^3x$ with a volume of integration of $z\gt 0$. If one uses a volume of integration of all space, then one arrives at the result in 7.

Many students essentially copied an online solution (without citation!) that states "The potential energy is twice the work required to move the particle to infinity. The reason they don't match is because the image particle is not a real particle. We must remember that there are actually no fields within the conductor. The potential energy calculation above is counting the energy of the fields in the conductor, which don't actually exist."

The problem with the statement of "We must remember that there are actually no fields within the conductor" is that no statement is made about why the calculation in 7. counts the energy of the fields in the conductor (the $z\lt 0$ region).  The other problem is copying an answer without citation.

# Long Dielectric Cylinder 

An infinitely long dielectric cylinder of radius $b$ is placed into a vacuum region of space with an initially uniform electric field $E_o\hat{\mathbf{x}}$. The cylinder is parallel to and centered on the $z-$axis.

The cylinder has a dielectric constant of $\epsilon$. Find the potential inside and outside of the dielectric.

----
In class, I mentioned that one could "guess" which terms in the general solution to $\nabla^2\psi(s,\phi)=0$ of

$$
\begin{align}
\psi(s,\phi)  = {} &  A_o+a_o\ln s\\
& +\sum_{n=1}^\infty (A_n\cos n\phi+B_n\sin n\phi)s^n\\
& +\sum_{n=1}^\infty (a_n\cos n\phi+b_n\sin n\phi)s^{-n}
\end{align}
$$

to keep and start the solution at that point. For this problem, start with the general solution and provide justification for constants that are zero. In the equations above, $s$ is the radial cylindrical coordinate and $\phi$ is the cylindrical angular coordinate.

Most students were able to get the correct answer, which is not surprising because this is a problem from Griffiths for which solutions can be found easily. The reason that I asked for justifications was to make sure that you understood the solutions that you were reading and/or could spot errors or poor logic. This was an opportunity to clarify your logic in solving these types of problems. Unfortunately, many students still used specious logic found on a Google search of "dielectric cylinder in a uniform electric field".

This is a problem with the logic of "the potential does not blow up" at infinity fails. The potential does "blow up" because it has a term proportional to $s$.

A common comment was that the condition $\epsilon/\epsilon_o=-1$ implied a set of coefficients were zero because $\epsilon$ had to be greater than zero. I wondered why this statement was made so frequently in student answers and I found a similar statement [https://physicspages.com/pdf/Griffiths%20EM/Griffiths%20Problems%2004.22.pdf here]. I accepted this because technically it is a valid statement, but there is a more general reason that applies. (One could be given a non-physical problem in which $\epsilon$ was negative and the set of coefficients would still be zero.) This is discussed in my solution.

In the following, I give two solutions to this problem. The first is the type of solution that I was looking for. The second is a brief solution that uses some intuition that is gained from solving these types of problems to make large steps with the only mathematical justification being that the guesses gave a solution that satisfied the boundary conditions and Laplace's equation and therefore it is the solution as a result of the uniqueness of solutions to Laplace's equation. You should be able to do these types of problems in both ways. Quite often on more complex problems, you can't rely on shortcuts of the type taken here and you need a solid understanding of the mathematical justifications for each step.

'''First Solution'''

To be posted.

----

'''Second Solution'''

For large $s$, we expect $\psi\rightarrow V_o - E_os\cos\theta$. Because there is a cosine term for large $s$, we expect a cosine term in the outer and inner solution (based on experience with the analogous sphere-in-a-dielectric problem). So we make an attempt for a solution using the following forms for the potential.

$$\psi_o=V_o+\frac{B_1}{s}\cos\phi-E_os\cos\phi$$

$$\psi_i=A_o+A_1s\cos\phi$$

The boundary condition

$\psi_o(s)=\psi_i(s)$

gives

$$A_o=V_o\quad \text{and}\quad A_1=B_1/a^2-E_o$$

The boundary condition

$$D_{os}-D_{is}=0$$

corresponds to

$$-\epsilon_o\frac{\partial \psi_o}{\partial s}+\epsilon\frac{\partial \psi_i}{\partial s} = 0$$

and this gives

$$B_1=-s_o^2E_o-\epsilon_rA_1s_o^2$$

which when combined with $A_1=B_1/a^2-E_o$ gives

$$B_1=\frac{1-\epsilon_r}{1+\epsilon_r}E_os_o^2$$

and

$$A_1=-\frac{2E_o}{\epsilon_r+1}$$

So the potentials are

$$\psi_o=V_o+E_o\frac{\epsilon_r-1}{\epsilon_r+1}\frac{s_o^2}{s}\cos\phi-E_os\cos\phi$$

$$\psi_i=V_o-\frac{2E_o}{\epsilon_r+1}s\cos\phi$$

Note when $\epsilon_r\rightarrow \infty$, is consistent with the solution for a conducting cylinder. For $s_o\rightarrow 0$ the solution is consistent with the solution for a line of charge with $\lambda=0$ (because all of the polarized charges are on top of each other) in an electric field $E_o\hat{\mathbf{x}}$: the inner potential, which corresponds to $\psi_i(0,\theta)$ in this limit) is $V_o$ and the outer potential is the external potential. The dielectric does not contribute to the electric field because the bound charges are on top of each other at the origin.

## Dipole in a Dielectric 

A perfect dipole $\mathbf{p}=p_o\hat{\mathbf{z}}$ at the origin is at the center of a dielectric sphere of radius $b$ that is centered on the origin. The dielectric constant of the sphere is $\epsilon$.

Find the potential inside and outside of the dielectric using the boundary value method. (You do not need to start with the full general solution for this problem - you may "guess" which terms from the full general solution will be non-zero and start your solution from there.)

Most students were able to get the following answers. Many students used the argument that the potential should be of the form

$$\psi = \psi_d + \sum_{l=0}^{\infty}A_lr^lP_l(\cos\theta)$$

where $\psi_d$ is the formula for a dipole in a dielectric. This is somewhat different than the approach I've seen in class and on homework. I was expecting to see

$$\psi = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty}A_lr^l+\frac{B_l}{r^{l+1}}P_l(\cos\theta)$$

and the argument $\psi(r\rightarrow 0,\theta)\rightarrow \psi_d = p_o\cos\theta/4\pi\epsilon r^2$, from which one would conclude that $B_1=p_o/4\pi\epsilon$ and $B_l=0$ otherwise. If you are using someone else's solution, it is always a good idea to do things more in the way that you are familiar with or in a different way to ensure that you are not just copying someone's answer and that you learn something from this. (I usually avoid giving problems where solutions are easily found using an internet search. I guess this one is easily found.)

1.

$$\psi(r,\theta)=\frac{p_o\cos\theta}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\frac{1}{r^2}$$

2.

$$\psi_i=\frac{p_o\cos\theta}{4\pi\epsilon}\left(\frac{1}{r^2}+2\frac{\epsilon_r-1}{1+2\epsilon_r}\frac{r}{b^3}\right)$$

$$\psi_o=\frac{p_o\cos\theta}{4\pi\epsilon}\frac{3}{1+2\epsilon_r}\frac{1}{r^2}$$

where $\epsilon_r=\epsilon/\epsilon_o$

# Discussion 

1. Read 5.8-5.10 of Jackson (and related parts of Griffiths)
1. Before 9 pm on April 28th, either (1) ask a substantial question on Piazza on a topic covered in 5.8-5.10 of Jackson or (2) answer a question on Piazza. I don't know how to define a "substantial" question beyond saying that your question should be specific and followed by comments on what you did in an attempt to answer the question yourself and a bit of introductory material. An example of a good question has been posted to Piazza. If you want to use equations, copy them from the course web page and modify them as needed. To see the LaTeX, use "Tools-View Source" on the left-hand-side menu on the course web page. In Piazza, all equations are surrounded by double dollar signs, e.g., <code>$$\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{B}=0$$</code>. Some of the equations on the course web page are surrounded by <code>$</code> and <code>$</code>, e.g., <code>$\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{B}=0$</code>; these need to be replaced with the double dollar sign.
1. Review the questions before we meet next.

# Amperes' Law 

A surface current flows uniformly on the surface of a long cylinder.

In general, in cylindrical coordinates, the magnetic field has the form

$$\mathbf{B}=B_s(s,\phi,z)\hat{\mathbf{s}}+B_{\phi}(s,\phi,z)\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}+B_z(s,\phi,z)\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

To use Amperes' law, arguments are made that the field must have the form

$$\mathbf{B}=B_{\phi}(s)\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$$

Provide a justification for the arguments needed to claim

1. $B_s(s,\phi,z)=0$
1. $B_z(s,\phi,z)=0$
1. $B_{\phi}$ does not depend on $\phi$ and $z$

Recall that Amperes' law generally only gives information about one component of the field (when there is enough symmetry to do so). Other physical arguments are needed to determine all components of the field and why Amperes' law can be used to find one component of the field.

There are two steps required to answer this question:

1. The field due to infinitely long wire along the $z$-axis is in the $\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$ direction.
1. The field due to wires placed uniformly along the surface of a cylinder to form a surface current $K_o$ is in the $\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$ direction.

To show 1., consider a differential element of wire on the $z$-axis at an arbitrary position $z'$.

$$\mathbf{B}_{dI}=\frac{\mu_o I}{4\pi}\frac{d\mathbf{l}\times\hat{\bf{\char"0509}}}{\char"0509^2}$$

where

$$\mathbf{\char"0509}=s\hat{\mathbf{s}}-z'\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

and

$$d\mathbf{l}=dz'\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

The cross product $$d\mathbf{l}\times\hat{\bf{\char"0509}}$$ is in the direction $\hat{\mathbf{z}}\times\hat{\mathbf{s}}=\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$. So all differential elements of current on the wire create a $\mathbf{B}$ in the $\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$ direction.

Therefore, the magnetic field due to an infinite wire is always tangent to a circle centered on the wire and in a plane perpendicular to the wire.

To show 2., consider the magnetic field at a point of interest in the $x$-$y$ plane on the $s$ axis created by the wires placed along the surface at equal distances above and below the $s$ axis as shown in the diagram. The current at $U$ and $L$ flows out of the page. Each wire creates a field that is tangent to a circle centered on the wire and with a direction determined by the right-hand rule. The field for the upper and lower wires is not each in the $\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$ in this coordinate system. The $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ components of the fields cancel, leaving only a component in the $\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$ direction. So every wire on the top half of the circle shown has a wire on the bottom half with a canceling $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$-component and so the field must be in the $\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$ direction.

[[Image:E2-cut.svg|300px]]

This explains why $B_s=B_z=0$. $B_{\phi}$ does not depend on $\phi$ because the diagram is the same for any $\phi$ (the $x$-axis could be drawn in any direction on this diagram, and the angle $\phi$ is the angle between the $x$-axis and the $\mathbf{s}$ axis). $B_{\phi}$ does not depend on $z$ because the diagram is not changed if the plane shown in the figure was shifted in the $z$ direction.

# Force on Current Loop 

The current loop of radius $b$ shown in the figure is in the $z=d$ plane carries a current $I$.

There is an external magnetic field of 

$$\mathbf{B}_{ext}=\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\frac{m_o}{r^3}\left(2\cos\theta\hat{\mathbf{r}}+\sin\theta\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\right)$$

that is due to a magnetic dipole at the origin.

1. Compute the force on the loop using equation 5.12 of Jackson ($\mathbf{F}=\int \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x})\times \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x\thinspace d^3x$). Give your answer in cartesian coordinates.
1. Provide an explanation for why Jackson does not used a primed integration variable in 5.12.
1. Compute the force on the loop using equation 5.69 of Jackson ($\mathbf{F}=\boldsymbol{\nabla}(\mathbf{m}\cdot\mathbf{B})$). Give your answer in cartesian coordinates.
1. Convert your answer to 1. into a power series in terms of powers of $b/d$ assuming $b/d\lt 1$.

There were several common errors. 
1. Some reported a force that depended on $r$ and $\theta$ either explicity or implicitly because their unit vectors appeared in their answer. It does not make sense for the force on an object to depend on a coordinate. It should depend on the parameters given in the problem. In addition, the force depended on a coordinate, we would write $\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x})=\int \mathbf{J}\times \mathbf{B}d^3x'$, which we don't - see the previous problem.
1. When computing the gradient of a function that involved $r$, $r$ was treated as a constant. More on this in the solution.
1. The wrong delta function representation of $\mathbf{J}$. You know that you need to get $\int \mathbf{I}\times \mathbf{B} dl$ after evaluating the delta function in the volume integral given, so this could have been used as a check that you had the correct delta function representation of $\mathbf{J}$.

1.

$$\mathbf{F}=\int \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x})\times \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x\thinspace d^3x$$

Many students had questions about representing $\mathbf{J}$ with a delta function. As a guide, recall that you know the result after application of the delta function in $\mathbf{J}$ should be

$$\mathbf{F}=\int \mathbf{I}\times \mathbf{\thinspace dl$$

where $\mathbf{B}$ is evaluated at the locations of the differential elements $dl$, and $dl\thinspace d\phi$ for this problem. It is easier to do this in cylindrical coordinates, but most attempted modifying Jackson's equation for a current loop of radius $a$ in the $x$-$y$ plane and centered on the origin:

$$J_{\phi}=I\sin\theta\thinspace\delta(\cos\theta)\frac{\delta (r-a)}{a}$$

where

$$\mathbf{J}=J_{\phi}(-\sin\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{x}}+\cos\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{y}})$$

By delta function identity #5 on page 26, $J_{\phi}$ above is equivalent to 

$$J_{\phi}=I\delta(\theta-\pi/2)\frac{\delta (r-a)}{a}$$

You can (correctly) guess and that show that for this problem, replacing $\pi/2$ with $\theta_o$ and $a$ with $r_o$,  where $\tan\theta_o=b/d$ and $r_o=\sqrt{d^2+b^2}$ will result the volume integral reducing to the line interal.

Several students asked how to derive Jackson's equation or the guessed modified equation, so I'll derive it here. A student also mentioned that they found [https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/128732/describing-a-circular-current-loop-as-delta-functions], but it didn't quite help. We need to find

$$\mathbf{J} = J(r,\theta)(-\sin\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{x}}+\cos\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{y}})$$

where $J(r,\theta)$ has the property that it is zero except for $(r,\theta)$ on the loop. $\delta(r-r_o)$ is zero except on the surface of a sphere of radius $r_o$ and $\delta(\theta-\theta_o)$ is zero except on the surface of a cone with apex angle $\theta_o$. The product of these two delta functions (corresponding to the intersection of these two surfaces) is non-zero only at positions on the loop. As in charge distribution problems, we need to find a constant $C$ in

$$J(r,\theta)=C\delta(r-r_o)\delta(\theta-\theta_o)$$

where $\tan\theta_o=b/d$ and $r_o=\sqrt{d^2+b^2}$. To determine $C$, note that integrating $J$ over all space is equivalent to multiplying the current by the length of the wire it flows through.

$$2\pi b I = \int J(\mathbf{x\thinspace d^3x=C\int \delta(r-r_o)\delta(\theta-\theta_o)\sin\theta_o\thinspacer\thinspace dc\thinspace d\the\thinspace d\phi$$

$$2\pi b I = C2\pi\sin\theta_o r_o^2\Rightarrow C = \frac{bI}{r_o^2\sin\theta_o }$$

$$J(r,\theta)=\frac{I b}{\sin\theta_o r_o^2}\delta(r-r_o)\delta(\theta-\theta_o)=\frac{I}{r_o}\delta(r-r_o)\delta(\theta-\theta_o)$$

When $\theta_o=\pi/2$, $r_o=b$ we recover Jackson's equation.

$$
\begin{align}
\mathbf{F} & = \int \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x})\times \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x\thinspace d^3x\\
& = \int  J(r,\theta)(-\sin\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{x}}+\cos\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{y}})\times \mathbf{B}(r,\theta)\thinspacer^2\sin\the\thinspace d\the\thinspace d\phi\\
& = \int  \frac{I}{r_o}\delta(r-r_o)\delta(\theta-\theta_o)(-\sin\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{x}}+\cos\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{y}})\times \mathbf{B}(r,\theta)\thinspacer^2\sin\the\thinspace d\the\thinspace d\phi\\
& = \int I (-\sin\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{x}}+\cos\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{y}})\times \mathbf{B}(r_o,\theta_o)\thinspacer_o\sin\theta\thinspace d\phi\\
& = \int I (-\sin\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{x}}+\cos\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{y}})\times \mathbf{B}(r_o,\theta_o)\thinspac\thinspace d\phi\\
& = \int I (-\sin\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{x}}+\cos\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{y}})\times \mathbf{B}(r_o,\theta_\thinspace dl
\end{align}
$$

This last equation is how I checked that I had the correct delta function. If I had used $\mathbf{F}=\int \mathbf{I}\times \mathbf{\thinspace dl$, this would be the result.

$$
\begin{align}
(-\sin\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{x}}+\cos\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{y}})\times \mathbf{B}(r_o,\theta_o) & =\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}\times \frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\frac{m_o}{r^3}\left(2\cos\theta\hat{\mathbf{r}}+\sin\theta\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\right)\\
& = \frac{\mu_oI}{4\pi}\frac{m_o}{r^3}(2\cos\theta\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}\times\hat{\mathbf{r}}+\sin\theta\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}\times\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}})\\
& = \frac{\mu_oI}{4\pi}\frac{m_o}{r^3}(2\cos\theta\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}-\sin\theta\hat{\mathbf{r}})\end{align}
$$

Prior to integration, non-cartesian vectors must be converted to cartesian. Use the spherical-to-cartesian transformation matrix

$$\begin{bmatrix}{\hat{\boldsymbol{r}}} \\ {\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta }}} \\ {\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi }}}\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}\sin \theta\cos \phi & \sin\theta \sin\phi & \cos\theta \\ \cos\theta \cos\phi & \cos\theta \sin\phi & -\sin\theta \\ -\sin\phi & \cos\phi & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}{\hat{\mathbf{x}}} \\ {\hat{\mathbf{y}}} \\{\hat{\mathbf{z}}}\end{bmatrix}$$

to write the spherical unit vectors $\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ using cartesian unit vectors and then integrate with respect to $d\phi$. The result is

$$\mathbf{F}=-\frac{3}{2}\frac{\mu_om_oIdb^2}{(b^2+d^2)^{5/2}}\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

One can get equivalent results by converting $\mathbf{B}_{ext}$ into cartesian using the above matrix and doing the cross product with $\mathbf{J}$ written with cartesian unit vectors. The components of $B_{ext}$ in cartesian coordinates, with $r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$, are

$$B_x=\frac{\mu_oI\pi a^2}{4\pi}\frac{3xz}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{5/2}}=\frac{\mu_oI\pi a^2}{4\pi}\frac{3xz}{r^5}$$

$$B_y=\frac{\mu_oI\pi a^2}{4\pi}\frac{3yz}{r^5}$$

$$B_z=\frac{\mu_oI\pi a^2}{4\pi}\frac{3z^2-r^2}{r^5}$$

Compute the horizontal, $B_s$, and vertical, $B_z$, magnetic field at all points on the loop. Then compute the horizontal and vertical forces created by these two fields individually. $B_s$ results in a vertical force on a differential element $dl$ of $-IdlB_s\hat{\mathbf{z}}$. $B_z$ results in a horizontal force of $IdlB_z\hat{\mathbf{s}}$.  The horizontal force averages to zero. The total vertical force is obtained by using $dl=bd\phi$ and integrating

$$\int_0^{2\pi}-IB_sbd\phi\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

The magnitude of horizontal field is $B_s=\sqrt{B_x^2+B_y^2}$ and $B_x$ and $B_y$ were found in a previous problem. Neither depend on $\phi$. The result is

$$B_s(x,y)=\sqrt{B_x^2+B_y^2}=\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\frac{3m_oz}{r^5}\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$$

On the loop, $z=d$, $x^2+y^2=b^2$, and $r^2=b^2+d^2$. Putting this all together gives a net force of

$$\mathbf{F}=-\frac{3}{2}\frac{\mu_om_oIdb^2}{(b^2+d^2)^{5/2}}\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

The primed notation is usually used for the dummy integration variable when the result after integration is a function of $\mathbf{x}$. Here the result after integration does not depend on position because we are computing the force on a current loop.

I accepted any answer to this question. I asked this because the lack of primes is something you should have noticed and asked yourself why primes are used in some integrals and not in others.

3.

$$\mathbf{m}=Ib^2\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

$$\mathbf{m}\cdot\mathbf{B}=Ib^2B_z$$

From the note in the solution to 1.,

$$B_z=\frac{\mu_oI\pi a^2}{4\pi}\frac{3z^2-r^2}{r^5}$$

The formula 

$$\mathbf{F}=\boldsymbol{\nabla}(\mathbf{m}\cdot\mathbf{B})$$

was derived by expanding $\mathbf{B}$ about around a point near a current loop and under the assumption that the change in $\mathbf{B}$ was small over the area of the loop and so the result must be evaluated at a point near the current loop, for which I use $(x,y,z)=(0,0,d)$. (Jackson says $\mathbf{B}$ is expanded about a "suitable origin" but does not elaborate on what constitutes suitableness. By default, it makes the most sense to expand about the center of the current distribution, but if the field changes more rapidly on one part of the current distribution, one may get a more accurate answer if the expansion is performed where the field changes the most. However, if the answer strongly depends on the origin, probably this approximate formula should not be used.)

$$\mathbf{F}=\left[\hat{\mathbf{x}}\frac{\partial B_z}{\partial x}+\hat{\mathbf{y}}\frac{\partial B_z}{\partial y}+\hat{\mathbf{z}}\frac{\partial B_z}{\partial z}\right]_{(x,y,z)=(0,0,d)}$$

The result is

$$\mathbf{F}=-\frac{3}{2}\frac{\mu_om_oIb^2}{d^4}\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

If interested, try evaluating the gradient of $B_z$ about a different location, say $0,b,z_o$ - you should get the same result to first order in a $b/d$  expansion. However, there will be a net force in the $y$-direction, which does not match the exact result. Therefore this choice of origin seems not "suitable". But to know it was not suitable, we had to know the exact result! As a result, I would argue that the approximate formula for an arbitrary current distribution is mostly useful for interpretation rather than calculation - $\mathbf{F}=\boldsymbol{\nabla}(\mathbf{m}\cdot\mathbf{B})$ means a gradient in its argument will result in a force.

The most common error students made was setting $r=b^2+d^2$ in

$$B_z=\frac{\mu_oI\pi a^2}{4\pi}\frac{3z^2-r^2}{r^5}$$

and not setting $z=d$. This is inconsistent because in setting $r=b^2+d^2$, $z$ was replaced with $d$. If $z$ was also replaced with $d$, $B_z$ would be constant and the computed force would be zero.

The force equation we are dealing with is based on the gradient of $\mathbf{B}$ and setting all variables to values, or worse, only some variables to values, in $\mathbf{B}$ will lead to an incorrect answer. One needs to substitute values for the variables after the derivatives are computed. (Think of finding the slope of $y=x^2$ at x=2. You don't first set $x=2$, giving $y=4$ and $dy/dx = 0$).

4.

The result from 1. was

$$\mathbf{F}=-\frac{3}{2}\frac{\mu_om_oIdb^2}{(b^2+d^2)^{5/2}}\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

or, after factoring out a $d^5$ in the denominator,

$$\mathbf{F}=-\frac{3}{2}\frac{\mu_om_oIb^2}{d^4\left(1+\left(\frac{b}{d}\right)^2\right)^{5/2}}\hat{\mathbf{z}}\simeq -\frac{3}{2}\frac{\mu_om_oIb^2}{d^4}\hat{\mathbf{z}}\left(1-\frac{5}{2}\frac{b^2}{d^2}\right)$$

which matches the result from 3. in the limit that $b/d\rightarrow 0$, as expected because the relevant length scales that determine how much $\mathbf{B}$ changes over the loop are the distance of the loop from the dipole to the length scale of the loop.

# Sphere with uniform $\mathbf{M}$ 

In Griffiths, 4rd edition, direct integration is used to find $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ for a uniformly magnetized sphere: $\mathbf{M}=M_o\hat{\mathbf{z}}$. The approach is to compute $\mathbf{J}_b$ and $\mathbf{K}_b$ using

$$\mathbf{J}_b=\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{M}$$

and

$$\mathbf{K}_b=\mathbf{M}\times\hat{\mathbf{n}}$$

Because $\mathbf{J}_b=0$, he starts with

$$\mathbf{A}=\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\int\frac{\mathbf{K}_b}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}da'$$

and integrates to compute $\mathbf{A}$ and then the relationship $\mathbf{B}=\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\mathbf{A}$ is used to find $\mathbf{B}$. 

Chapter 5.10 of Jacksons contains a related solution.

In this problem, the boundary value method will be used. 

Recall that the Maxwell macroscopic equations for the magnetic field are 

$$\boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{B}=0\quad\text{and}\quad \boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\mathbf{H}=\mathbf{J}_f$$

where $\mathbf{J}_f$ is the free current. Using the defining relationship for $\mathbf{H}$, $\mathbf{B}=\mu_o(\mathbf{H}+\mathbf{M})$, and $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{B}=0$, these equations can be written as

$$\boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{H}=-\boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}\quad\text{and}\quad \boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\mathbf{H}=\mathbf{J}_f$$

When $\mathbf{J}_f=0$, $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\mathbf{H}=0$ and thus one can write $\mathbf{H}$ as the gradient of a scalar function that will be called $\psi_m$: $\mathbf{H}=-\boldsymbol{\nabla}\psi_m$ and so

$$\nabla^2\psi_m=\boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}$$

For a uniformly magnetized sphere, $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}=0$ except at the surface of the sphere. The problem has azimuthal symmetry, so we can write $\psi_m=\psi_m(r,\theta)$ using the general solution to Laplace's equation for a problem with azimuthal symmetry:

$$\psi_m(r,\theta)=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\left(A_lr^l + B_lr^{-l-1}\right)P_l(\cos\theta)$$

This equation applies both inside and outside of the sphere (but not at the surface of the sphere).

Using one or more of the boundary conditions

1. $\psi_m$ finite for $r=0$
1. $\psi_m\rightarrow 0$ as $r\rightarrow\infty$
1. $\psi_m$ is continuous
1. $(\mathbf{B}_2-\mathbf{B_1})\boldsymbol{\cdot}\hat{\mathbf{n}}=0$

find $\mathbf{B}$ and then $\mathbf{A}$.

To solve this using the boundary value method, start with

$$\psi(r,\theta)=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\left(A_lr^l + B_lr^{-l-1}\right)P_l(\cos\theta)$$

BC 1. gives $B_l=0$ for the inner potential, $\psi_i$. BC 2. gives $A_l=0$ for the outer potential, $\psi_o$. The potentials thus simplify to

$$\psi_i=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}A_lr^lP_l(\cos\theta)$$

$$\psi_o=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\frac{B_l}{r^{l+1}}P_l(\cos\theta)$$

BC 3. gives

$$B_l=A_la^{2l+1}$$

BC 4. can be re-written as

$$\frac{\partial \psi_o}{\partial r}\Biggm\lvert_{r=a}=\frac{\partial \psi_i}{\partial r}\Biggm\lvert_{r=a}-\thinspaceM_o\cos\theta$$

From this,

$$A_1=M_o-\frac{2B_1}{a^3}$$

and

$$A_l=-aB_l\frac{l+1}{l}\quad l\ne 1$$

When these are combined with $B_l=A_la^{2l+1}$, the result is

$$B_1=A_1a^3$$

and

$$B_l=A_l=0\quad l\ne 1$$

Finally,

$$\psi_i=\frac{M_o}{3}r\cos\theta\qquad\qquad \psi_o=\frac{M_o}{3}\frac{a^3}{r^2}\cos\theta$$

The gradient in spherical coordinates is

$$\boldsymbol{\nabla}=\hat{\mathbf{r}}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}+\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}$$

and so $\mathbf{H}=-\boldsymbol{\nabla}\psi$ gives

$$\mathbf{H}_i=\frac{M_o}{3}\left(-\cos\theta\hat{\mathbf{r}}+\sin\theta\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\right)=-\frac{M_o}{3}\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

and

$$\mathbf{H}_o=\frac{M_o}{3}\frac{a^3}{r^3}\left(2\cos\theta\hat{\mathbf{r}}+\sin\theta\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\right)$$

Using $\mathbf{B}=\mu_o(\mathbf{H}+\mathbf{M})$ gives

$$\mathbf{B}_i=\mu_o(\mathbf{H}_i+M_o\hat{\mathbf{z}})=\frac{2}{3}\mu_oM_o\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

and

$$\mathbf{B}_o=\mu_oH_o=\mu_o\frac{M_o}{3}\frac{a^3}{r^3}\left(2\cos\theta\hat{\mathbf{r}}+\sin\theta\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\right)$$

To compute $\mathbf{A}$, one could use the method given in Jackson section 5.10. Alternatively, $\mathbf{A}$ can be arrived at by analogy. Outside, $\mathbf{B}$ has the form of of a magnetic dipole at the origin with a dipole moment of $\mathbf{m} = \hat{\mathbf{z}}4\pi a^3M_o/3$. Using this with the magnetic dipole equation $(\mu_o/4\pi)\thinspace{\mathbf{m}\times \mathbf{r}}/{r^3}$,

$$\mathbf{A}_o=\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\frac{\mathbf{m}\times \mathbf{r}}{r^3}=\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\frac{4\pi a^3M_o}{3}\frac{\hat{\mathbf{z}}\times \hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}=\mu_o\frac{M_oa^3}{3}\frac{\sin\theta}{r^2}\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$$

Inside, the magnetic field is uniform, which is the case for an infinitely long solenoid, so

$$\mathbf{A}_i=\frac{B_i}{2}s\thinspace\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$$

where $s$ is the cylindrical radius, which in spherical coordinates is $s=r\sin\theta$ so that 

$$\mathbf{A}_i=\mu_o\frac{M_o}{3}r\sin\theta\thinspace\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$$

'''Alternative solution method 1'''

To check your answers, note that the solution for $\mathbf{A}$ using direct integration is given as example and example in Jackson section 5.10 and Griffiths 6.1 and 5.11. (Note the differences in approach to the integration between Jackson and Griffiths).  From this, one can compute $\mathbf{B}=\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{A}$ and then use  $\mathbf{B}=\mu_o(\mathbf{H}+\mathbf{M})$ and $\mathbf{H}=-\nabla\psi_m$ to compute $\psi_m$. 

'''Alternative solution method for $\psi$'''

With the direct integration method, one needs to evaluate

$$\psi_m=\frac{1}{4\pi}\oint_S\frac{\hat{\mathbf{n}}'\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}da'$$

(see Jackson equation 5.100).  With $\hat{\mathbf{n}}'=\hat{\mathbf{r}}'$ and $\mathbf{M}=M_o\hat{\mathbf{z}}$, the numerator is

$$\hat{\mathbf{n}}'\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}=M_o\hat{\mathbf{r}}'\boldsymbol{\cdot}\hat{\mathbf{z}}= M_o\cos\theta'$$

and the integral is identical to that for a uniformly polarized sphere or a sphere with a surface charge that varies as $\cos\theta$; both problems are typically given as textbook examples and their solutions can be used to quickly write down the answer. 

'''Alternative solution method for $\mathbf{A}$'''

An alternative approach to computing $\mathbf{A}$ outside is to use the same approach typically used to compute $\mathbf{A}$ inside an infinitely long solenoid. First, note that the magnetic flux through a surface $\mathcal{S}$ bounded by a curve $\mathcal{C}$

$$\int_{\mathcal{S}}\mathbf{B}\boldsymbol{\cdot}d\mathbf{a}=\int_{\mathcal{S}} (\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{A})\boldsymbol{\cdot}d\mathbf{a}=\oint_{\mathcal{C}} \mathbf{A}\boldsymbol{\cdot}d\mathbf{l}$$

where the last equality follows from Stokes' theorem. (Note that surface is not required to be closed; if it is closed, the line integral is zero.) Inside the sphere, choose any loop with $r_{loop} < a$ that is parallel to the $x-y$ plane centered on the $z$-axis to compute $A_{\phi}$, which by symmetry$^*$ must be constant around the loop. Then

$$\oint \mathbf{A}(r,\theta,\phi)\boldsymbol{\cdot}d\mathbf{l}=\oint A_{\phi}(r,\theta) r_{loop}d\phi=2\pi r_{loop} A_{\phi}(r,\theta)=2\pi r\sin\theta A_{\phi}$$

where $r_{loop}$ was written in spherical coordinates using $r_{loop}=r\sin\theta$. 

$^*$ The symmetry argument is that $A_{\phi}$ does not depend on $\phi$ because the geometry is invariant with a rotation by $\phi$. 

At this point we have not addressed $A_r$ and $A_{\theta}$. Providing a symmetry argument for why these are zero is somewhat complicated, in part because an argument is needed for loops that are fully inside or outside of the sphere. Inside the sphere, one could use the same arguments used to justify a uniform magnetic field inside of a long solenoid. Outside the sphere, one would need to make an argument for why after integration, $\int \mathbf{\thinspace d^3x'/|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|$ will only have a $\phi$ component. As an alternative, one could use the fact that if $A_r=0$ and $A_{\theta}=0$, $\mathbf{B}=\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{A}$ and $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{A}=0$ and use uniqueness to justify the claim $A_r=0$ and $A_{\theta}=0$.

The magnetic field is constant, so the flux calculation does not require integration:

$$\int \mathbf{B}\boldsymbol{\cdot}d\mathbf{a}=B_{iz}\pi r_{loop}^2=B_{iz}\pi(r\sin\theta)^2$$

Solving for $A_{\phi}$ gives

$$A_{\phi i}=\frac{B_{iz}}{2}r\sin\theta=\frac{1}{3}\mu_oM_or\sin\theta$$

Outside the sphere, one must choose a loop with $r_{loop} > a$ that is above or below the $x-y$ plane (choosing a loop in the $x-y$ plane will give $A_{\phi}$ that is only valid for $\theta=\pi/2$). Note that if the loop is at $|z|<a$, the flux is computed using both the inside and outside magnetic field. To compute the flux, it is most convenient to use the cylindrical equation for $\mathbf{B}$, which is

$$B_{zo}(s,z)=\mu_o\frac{M_oa^3}{3}\frac{2z^2-s^2}{(s^2+z^2)^{5/2}}$$

For $|z|\lt a$, the flux calculation requires adding the flux through the area inside inside the sphere to the flux through the area outside the sphere:

$$\int \mathbf{B}\boldsymbol{\cdot}d\mathbf{a} = B_{zi} \pi (a\sin\theta)^2 +  \int_0^{2\pi}\int_{a\sin\theta}^{s}B_{zo}(s')s'ds'd\phi $$

Using $B_{zi}=\frac{2}{3}\mu_oM_o$,

$$\int \mathbf{B}\boldsymbol{\cdot}d\mathbf{a} = \frac{2}{3}\mu_oM_o\pi (a\sin\theta)^2 +  \int_0^{2\pi}\int_{a\sin\theta}^{s}B_{zo}(s')s'ds'd\phi$$

$$\int_0^{2\pi}\int_{a\sin\theta}^{s}B_{zo}(s')s'ds'd\phi =\mu_o\frac{2\pi M_oa^3}{3}\int_{a\sin\theta}^{s}\frac{2z^2-s^2}{(s^2+z^2)^{5/2}}s'ds'$$

$$
\begin{align}
\int_{a\sin\theta}^{s}\frac{2z^2-s^2}{(s^2+z^2)^{5/2}}s'ds' & = \left[-\frac{2}{3}\frac{z^2}{(s^2+z^2)^{3/2}}+\frac{s^2+\frac{2}{3}z^2}{(s^2+z^2)^{3/2}}\right]_{a\sin\theta}^{s}\\
& =-\frac{2}{3}\frac{z^2}{(s^2+z^2)^{3/2}}+\frac{s^2+\frac{2}{3}z^2}{(s^2+z^2)^{3/2}}+\frac{2}{3}\frac{z^2}{(a^2\sin^2\theta+z^2)^{3/2}}-\frac{a^2\sin^2\theta+\frac{2}{3}z^2}{(a^2\sin^2\theta+z^2)^{3/2}}\\
& =-\frac{2}{3}\frac{z^2}{r^3}+\frac{s^2+\frac{2}{3}z^2}{r^3}+\frac{2}{3}\frac{z^2}{a^3}-\frac{a^2\sin^2\theta+\frac{2}{3}z^2}{a^3}\\
& =\frac{s^2}{r^3}-\frac{a^2\sin^2\theta}{a^3}
\end{align}
$$

where $a^2\sin^2\theta+z^2=a^2$ and $r^2=s^2+z^2$ was used.

and the line integral of $\mathbf{A}$ is the same as it was when the area was fully inside the sphere.

$$
\begin{align}
\int \mathbf{B}\boldsymbol{\cdot}d\mathbf{a} & = \frac{2}{3}\mu_oM_o\pi (a\sin\theta)^2 +  \mu_o\frac{2\pi M_oa^3}{3}\left[\frac{s^2}{r^3}-\frac{a^2\sin^2\theta}{a^3}\right]\\
& = \mu_o\frac{2\pi M_oa^3}{3}\frac{s^2}{r^3}\\
& = \mu_o\frac{2\pi M_oa^3}{3}\frac{\sin^2\theta}{r}
\end{align}
$$

Setting this equal to $\oint\mathbf{A}\cdot d\mathbf{l}=2\pi r\sin\theta A_{\phi}$ and solving for $A_{\phi o}$ gives

$$A_{\phi o}=\mu_o\frac{M_oa^2}{3}\frac{\sin\theta}{r^2}$$

Recall that this solution is only valid for $|z|\le a$. For $|z|\gt a$, the only contribution to the flux is from the magnetic field outside of the sphere: 

$$\int \mathbf{B}\boldsymbol{\cdot}d\mathbf{a}=\int_0^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{s}B_{zo}(s')s'ds'd\phi$$

Evaluation of this integral will give the same result as the flux integral for $|z|\le a$ and so the vector potential outside the sphere is the same and given by $A_{\phi o}$ found above.

# Cylinder Boundary Value Problem 

A  cylinder of radius $s_o$ has a magnetization

$$\mathbf{M}=(ps\sin 2\phi + qs\cos\phi)\hat{\mathbf{s}}+(\frac{1}{2}ps\cos 2\phi-qs\sin\phi)\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$$ 

where $s$ is the cylindrical radial coordinate and $p$ and $q$ are constants. Find $\mathbf{B}$ due to the cylinder.

Use similar boundary conditions as the previous problem (replacing the spherical coordinate system radius $r$ with the cylindrical coordinate system radius $s$). In addition, note that the absence of magnetic monopoles means that $\psi_m$ cannot scale as $\ln s$ for large $s$.

An alternative way of obtaining a solution is to note that 
    
$$\mathbf{K}_b=\mathbf{M}\times\hat{\mathbf{n}}=M_o\hat{\mathbf{z}}\times\hat{\mathbf{s}}=M_o\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$$

1.

The macroscopic Maxwell equations associated with the magnetic field are 

$$\boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{B}=0\quad\text{and}\quad \boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\mathbf{H}=\mathbf{J}_f$$

where $\mathbf{J}_f$ is the free current (i.e., not bound current). Using the definition of the magnetization implied by $\mathbf{B}=\mu_o(\mathbf{H}+\mathbf{M})$ and $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{B}=0$, the macroscopic equations can be written as

$$\boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{H}=-\boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}\quad\text{and}\quad \boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\mathbf{H}=\mathbf{J}_f$$

When $\mathbf{J}_f=0$, $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\mathbf{H}=0$ so one can write $\mathbf{H}$ as the gradient of a scalar function that will be called $\psi_m$: $\mathbf{H}=-\boldsymbol{\nabla}\psi_m$ and so

$$\nabla^2\psi_m=\boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}$$

From this, it follows that

$$\psi_m=-\frac{1}{4\pi}\int\frac{\boldsymbol{\nabla}'\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}d^3x'$$

If $\mathbf{M}$ has a discontinuity on a surface $\mathcal{S}$ of the volume $\mathcal{V}$ such that it is zero outside of $\mathcal{V}$, this can be written as

$$\psi_m=-\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_V\frac{\boldsymbol{\nabla}'\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}d^3x'+\frac{1}{4\pi}\oint_S\frac{\hat{\mathbf{n}}'\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}da'$$

In this problem, the first form 

$$\psi_m=-\frac{1}{4\pi}\int\frac{\boldsymbol{\nabla}'\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}d^3x'$$

can be used if $\mathbf{M}$ is represented using the Heaviside step function $\Theta$:

$$\mathbf{M}=M_o\Theta(a-s)\Big[\Theta(z+L)-\Theta(z-L)\Big]\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

so that

(Verify graphically that this makes sense by plotting $M$ as a function of $z$; for example when $z=L$, from the graph we expect the slope of $\frac{\partial M_z}{\partial z}$ to be $-\infty$.)

Several students attempted to use the expansion of $1/|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|$ with $r=z$ in terms of Legendre polynomials. This is a good idea, but there are several complications.

Complication A: One could use the last two equations on page 103 of Jackson to conclude that

$$\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\frac{c^l}{z^{l+1}}P_l(\cos\alpha)\qquad z\gt c$$

$$\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\frac{z^{l+1}}{c^l}P_l(\cos\alpha)\qquad z\lt c$$

where $\cos\alpha=L/\sqrt{s'^2+L^2}$ and $c=\sqrt{s'^2+L^2}$. To find the potential for a disk of charge, one needs to integrate from $s'=0$ to $s'=b$. This integration is complicated by the fact that the argument to the Legendre polynomials depends on $s'$. For this problem, there is a similar complication as one also needs to integrate from $s'=0$ to $s'=b$.

Complication B:  The expansions given above are for $z\gt c$ and $z\lt c$. So if you integrated these expansions, the result would be valid for $z\gt c_{max}$ and $z\lt c_{max}$, where $c^2_{max}=b^2+L^2$. However, the problem statement asks for the potential when $z\pm L\gg b$, which is not the same as either of these conditions. (To see this, draw out the regions where the solutions apply for $z\gt c_{max}$, $z\lt c_{max}$, and $z\pm L\gg b$). The region $z\pm L\gg b$ corresponds to a $z$ that is a large distance away from both caps. If $L$ is large compared to $b$, such a point could be the origin.

The equation in the steps shown above that occurs after evaluation of the Heavyside step and Dirac delta functions is what would have been found if we had started with

$$\psi_m=-\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{\mathcal{V}}\frac{\boldsymbol{\nabla}'\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}d^3x'+\frac{1}{4\pi}\oint_{\mathcal{S}}\frac{\hat{\mathbf{n}}'\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}da'$$
 
Inside $\mathcal{V}$, $\boldsymbol{\nabla}'\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}=0$, which leaves only the surface integral. The surface integral on the curved surface of the cylinder is zero because $\hat{\mathbf{s}}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}$; the top and bottom caps of the cylinder only contribute and ($\mathbf{n}=\pm \hat{\mathbf{z}}$ on the top/bottom of the cylinder.

At least one student attempted to use the expansion of $1/|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|$ for $r=z$ in terms of Legendre polynomials. This is a good idea, but there is a complication that one needs to address. The angle $\alpha$ is not $\theta$ and so $P_l(\cos\alpha$ will depend on $\phi$. This complication was discussed at length in my notes on this expansion. See the example for the offset charged ring given in section 3.3 of Jackson for how to handle this.

For $a^2/(z\pm L)^2\ll 1$ and using $(1+\Delta)^n\simeq 1+n\Delta$

$$
\begin{align}
\psi_m & \simeq -\frac{M_o}{2}\int_0^{a}\frac{s'ds'}{|z+L|}\left(1-\frac{s'^2}{2(z+L)^2}\right) + \frac{M_o}{2}\int_0^{a}\frac{s'ds'}{|z-L|}\left(1-\frac{s'^2}{2(z-L)^2}\right)\\\\
& = \frac{M_o}{2}\left[\frac{a^2}{2}\left(\frac{1}{|z-L|}-\frac{1}{|z+L|}\right)+\frac{a^4}{4}\left(\frac{1}{|z-L|^3}-\frac{1}{|z+L|^3}\right)\right]
\end{align}
$$

The absolute value signs are important here. If the condition was $a^2/(z\pm L)^2\lt 1$, it would mean that we are finding a solution that applies to all points on the $z$-axis except in a region of $\pm a$ above and below the ends of the cylinder. If $L\gg a$, the region where the solution is valid would include the origin and $z\gg L$ and these regions have a different functional for for the potential.

2.

The exact integral of

$$\psi_m=-\frac{M_o}{2}\int_0^{a}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{s'^2+(z+L)^2}}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{s'^2+(z-L)^2}}\right)s'ds'$$

is

$$\psi_m=\frac{M_o}{2}\left(\sqrt{a^2+(z-L)^2}-\sqrt{a^2+(z+L)^2}-|z-L|+|z+L|\right)$$

When the absolute values are accounted for, the potential function depends on if the point is inside or outside of the cylinder:

$$
\psi_m=\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\frac{M_o}{2}\left(\sqrt{a^2+(z-L)^2}-\sqrt{a^2+(z+L)^2}+2z\right) & \mbox{if } |z| \le L \\
\frac{M_o}{2}\left(\sqrt{a^2+(z-L)^2}-\sqrt{a^2+(z+L)^2}+2L\right) & \mbox{if } |z| \ge L
\end{array}
\right.
$$

To verify consistency with the approximate answer, factor out $z\pm L$ from the square root terms and use $(1+\Delta)^n\simeq 1+n\Delta$ with $\Delta = a/(z\pm L)$. (And be careful to use $\sqrt{u^2}=|u|$ when $u$ can be positive or negative!

$$
\begin{align}
\psi_m & = \frac{M_o}{2}\left(\sqrt{a^2+(z-L)^2}-\sqrt{a^2+(z+L)^2}-|z-L|+|z+L|\right)\\\\
& = \frac{M_o}{2}\left(|z-L|\sqrt{1+a^2/(z-L)^2}-|z+L|\sqrt{1+a^2/(z+L)^2}-|z-L|+|z+L|\right)\\\\
& \simeq \frac{M_o}{2}\frac{a^2}{2}\left(\frac{|z-L|}{(z-L)^2}-\frac{|z+L|}{(z+L)^2}\right)\\\\
& = \frac{M_oa^2}{4}\left(\frac{1}{|z-L|}-\frac{1}{|z+L|}\right)
\end{align}
$$

3.

Using

$$
\begin{align}
\mathbf{B}(z) & =\mu_o\mathbf{H}(z)+\mu_o\mathbf{M}(z)\\
& =-\mu_o\boldsymbol{\nabla}\psi_{m}+\mu_oM_o\big[\Theta(z+L)-\Theta(z-L)\big]\hat{\mathbf{z}}
\end{align}
$$

and

$$\boldsymbol{\nabla}\psi_{m}=\hat{\mathbf{z}}\frac{\partial \psi_m}{\partial z}$$

and recalling that $\partial |x|/\partial x=x/|x|$ gives

$$\frac{\partial \psi_m}{\partial z}=\frac{M_o}{2}\left(\frac{z-L}{\sqrt{a^2+(z-L)^2}}-\frac{z+L}{\sqrt{a^2+(z+L)^2}}-\frac{z-L}{|z-L|}+\frac{z+L}{|z+L|}\right)$$

(An alternative is to use the form of the solution given that applies inside and outside of the cylinder and then compute their derivatives separately to avoid needing to use $\partial |x|/\partial x=x/|x|$.)

The solution depends whether $z$ corresponds to inside or outside of the cylinder:

$|z|\ge L$
$$H_z=-\frac{\partial \psi_m}{\partial z}=-\frac{M_o}{2}\left(\frac{z-L}{\sqrt{a^2+(z-L)^2}}-\frac{z+L}{\sqrt{a^2+(z+L)^2}}\right)$$

$|z|\le L$
$$H_z=-\frac{\partial \psi_m}{\partial z}=-\frac{M_o}{2}\left(\frac{z-L}{\sqrt{a^2+(z-L)^2}}-\frac{z+L}{\sqrt{a^2+(z+L)^2}}+2\right)$$

This, along with the evaluation of the step function in the equation above for $\mathbf{B}(z)$ gives a single equation for the magnetic field

$$\mathbf{B}=\frac{\mu_oM_o}{2}\left[\frac{z+L}{\sqrt{a^2+(z+L)^2}}-\frac{z-L}{\sqrt{a^2+(z-L)^2}}\right]$$
    
So the system is equivalent to a solenoid of height $L$ and radius $a$, which is a standard example problem with a solution along the $z-$axis of

$$B_z=\frac{\mu_o K}{2}\left[\frac{z+L}{\sqrt{a^2+(z+L)^2}}-\frac{z-L}{\sqrt{a^2+(z-L)^2}}\right]$$

This observation also points to another way to check your answer. In the limit that $z\gg a \gg L$, the field should approach that from a magnetic dipole along its axis. In this limit, the cylinder looks like a ring, which has an axial field of

$$B_z=\frac{\mu_o Ia^2}{2}\frac{1}{(a^2+z^2)^{3/2}}$$

# Delta Function (5 pts) 

A charge $Q$ is uniformly distributed on the surface of a sphere of radius $b$. 

Write the equation for the charge density using the Dirac delta function.

{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! align="left" |&nbsp;Answer
|-
|
$$\rho = \frac{Q}{4\pi b^2}\delta(r-b)$$

Or, equivalently,

$$\rho = \frac{Q}{4\pi r^2}\delta(r-b)$$

Both satisfy

$$Q=\int\rho(\mathbf{x\thinspace d^3x = \int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_0^{\pi}\int_0^{\infty} \rho(\mathbf{x})\thinspacer^2 dr\sin\the\thinspace d\the\thinspace d\phi$$

and are zero everywhere except at $r=b$.

This charge density is easy to guess and verify. Earlier in the semester, I went over the derivation for problems like this. The charge density should be zero everywhere except at $r=b$ and the integral of charge density should be $Q$. Given the problem statement, one can write

$$\rho=C\delta(r-b)$$

and determine the constant $C$ from

$$Q = \int \r\thinspace d^3x$$

where the integral is over all space. In spherical coordinates, for $\rho=\rho(r)$,

$$Q = 4\pi\int_0^{\infty}\rho\thinspacer^2dr=4\pi\int_0^{\infty}C\delta(r-b)r^2dr=C4\pi b^2$$

This gives $C=Q/4\pi b^2$ so that

$$\rho = \frac{Q}{4\pi b^2}\delta(r-b)$$

In the problem statement, I did not ask for the volume charge density. However, this is implied as the delta function is always used to write volume charge densities - part of the motivation for introducing it is so that we don't need to write three equations for the electric field - one for a line of charge, one for a surface charge, and one for a volume charge. With the delta function, only the volume charge equation is needed and the volume integral will reduce to either a surface or line integral.

# Capacitance (20 pts) 

A charge of $+Q$ is put on a conducting sphere of radius $b$ and $-Q$ on a sphere of radius $c$. The centers of the spheres are separated by a distance $d$.

1. Describe how the surface charge density on the spheres will change as $d$ increases.
1. Estimate the capacitance assuming $b<<d$ and $c<<d$. (By estimate, I mean that you do not need to solve the boundary value problem to compute the exact potential.) 
1. If the exact capacitance was computed, would it be larger or smaller than your answer to part 2.?

{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! align="left" |&nbsp;Solution
|-
|
1.

As $d$ increases, the surface charge distribution will become more uniform (the field due to charges on sphere $b$ does not affect the surface charge distribution on sphere $c$ when they are separated by a large distance, and vice-versa).

2.

Capacitance is determined by placing $+Q$ on one surface and $-Q$ on the other. Then, the potential difference between the surfaces, $\Delta V$, is computed and the capacitance is $C=Q/|\Delta V|$.

If $d=\infty$, the potential on the surface of $b$ is due only to the charges on sphere $b$. Similar for $c$.

Assuming $\Psi(r=\infty)=0$, the at the surface of sphere $b$,

$$\Psi_b(r=b) = \frac{kQ}{b}$$

and at the surface of $c$,

$$\Psi_c(r=c) = -\frac{kQ}{c}$$

The potential difference is

$$\Delta V=\Psi_b(r=b)-\Psi_c(r=c)=kQ\left(\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}\right)$$

So the capacitance is

$$C\equiv \frac{Q}{|\Delta V|} = 4\pi\epsilon_o\frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}\right)}$$

(When I went over this in class, someone asked if we could set the potential of sphere $b$ to be zero. I said no, but did not clarify. You can, but then you need to account for the fact that the potential of sphere $c$ will not be simply $-kQ/c$. If you set the potential of sphere $b$ to be zero, then the potential at $r=\infty$ is not zero. It will be $\Psi_{\infty}=-kQ/b$. Then the potential of sphere $c$ is $-kQ/b-kQ/c$ and $\Delta V$ is the same as found above.

3. 

I was looking for any answer that involved a statement about either of the following effects:

1. the electric field between the spheres is different when the charges are not uniformly distributed
1. as $d$ increases, the integration of the electric field is over a larger distance

Several students mentioned that the net charge on the spheres would change as $d$ increased. This is true of the spheres are connected to a battery, but no battery was mentioned. Recall that capacitance can be computed in two ways: (1) assuming $\pm Q$ the conductors and that they are isolated and finding the potential outside the conductors (usually via the electric field) and (2) assuming the conductors are held at a potential difference (by, for example, a battery), computing the potential outside of the conductors, and then computing the charge density (using $d\psi/dn$) and finally the total charge on each conductor.

{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! align="left" |&nbsp;Notes
|-
|
There are two influences on the capacitance - the separation distance and the distribution of charges on the spheres.

1. Suppose $d$ is fixed. The electric field between the spheres will be larger when the charges are shifted towards their faces versus then when they are uniformly distributed. In this case, the electric field and potential difference between the spheres will be smaller for a uniform charge distribution. Given that a uniform charge distribution is associated with large $d$, the capacitance is expected to increase as $d$ increases. 
1. Suppose the charge distribution is fixed (so the electric field equation does not change when $d$ changes). As $d$ increases, the integration of the electric field is over a larger distance and so the potential difference increases. The result is a decrease in capacitance. (This effect is apparent in the formula for the capacitance of two large parallel plates: $C=\epsilon_oA/d$ - as $d$ increases, $C$ decreases.)

The second effect turns out to dominate. As $d$ increases, the capacitance decreases. One can get a capacitance by neglecting the first effect by assuming that the charge distribution on the spheres is uniform. This capacitance will be an upper limit on the actual capacitance.

Assume that sphere $c$ is to the right of sphere $b$.

The total potential is

$$\Psi = \Psi_b + \Psi_c$$

With sphere $b$ centered on the origin and sphere $c$ centered on $x=d$,

$$\Psi_b(x,y,z) = \frac{kQ}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}$$

$$\Psi_c(x,y,z) =  -\frac{kQ}{\sqrt{(x-d)^2+y^2+z^2}}$$

and so

$$\Psi =  \frac{kQ}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}} - \frac{kQ}{\sqrt{(x-d)^2+y^2+z^2}}$$

The potential difference between the surface of $b$ and $c$ can be determined by finding $\Psi$ on each surface. Because $\Psi$ is constant on these surfaces (they are conductors), it is easiest to find the potential difference between the points $(x,y,z)=(b,0,0)$ and $(x,y,z)=(d-c,0,0)$.

$$\Delta V = \Psi(x=b,0,0) - \Psi(x=d-c,0,0) = kQ\left(\frac{1}{b}-\frac{1}{d-b}-\left(\frac{1}{d-c}-\frac{1}{c}\right)\right)$$

This equation can be rearranged to find the capacitance

$$C\equiv \frac{Q}{|\Delta V|} = 4\pi\epsilon_o\frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}-\frac{1}{d-b}-\frac{1}{d-c}\right)}$$

The denominator can be re-written as

$$\left(\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}-\frac{1}{d}\frac{1}{1-b/d}-\frac{1}{d}\frac{1}{1-c/d}\right)$$

Using $1/(1-\delta)\simeq 1+\delta$ for $\delta \ll 1$, gives

$$\left(\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}-\frac{1}{d}\frac{1}{1-c/d}-\frac{1}{d}\frac{1}{1-b/d}\right) \simeq \left(\frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{b} - \frac{2}{d}\right)$$

This gives

$$C \simeq 4\pi\epsilon_o\frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{b}- \frac{2}{d}\right)}$$

Using $1/(1-\delta)\simeq 1+\delta$ again

$$C \simeq C_o\left(1 + \frac{2}{d\left(\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}\right)}\right)$$

where

$$C_o= 4\pi\epsilon_o\frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}\right)}$$

is the capacitance found when $d=\infty$ was assumed.  If $b=c$, then this simplifies to

$$C \simeq C_o\left(1 + \frac{b}{d}\right)$$

For details on how to compute the exact capacitance, see [https://www.iue.tuwien.ac.at/phd/wasshuber/node77.html], [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0031-8949/2/3/001], and [http://www.electrostatics.org/images/Banerjee_ESA2014_paper_corrected.pdf].

# Surface Current on Cylinder 

A hollow and open-ended cylinder of height $2h$ and radius $b$ is centered on the origin and aligned with the $z$-axis. The curved surface of the cylinder has a surface current of $K_o\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$.

1. Find an expression for $\mathbf{B}$ everywhere inside the cylinder in terms of an infinite series involving Legendre polynomials.
1. Describe at least one limit used to check your answer to 1.

1.

'''Method 1.'''

Inside of the cylinder, $\nabla^2\Phi_m=0$ is satisfied. The problem has azimuthal symmetry and so the solutions must be of the form of 

$$\Phi_m(r,\theta)=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\left(A_lr^l + B_lr^{-l-1}\right)P_l(\cos\theta)$$

which has an associated magnetic field of $\mathbf{B}(r,\theta) = -\nabla\Phi_m$.

To find the coefficients $A_l$ and $B_l$, use direct integration to find $\mathbf{B}(z)$. This is a standard textbook example problem and the solution is given in problem 5.3 of Jackson. Due to the uniqueness of solutions to Laplace's equation, the equations for $\mathbf{B}(r,\theta)$ and $\mathbf{B}(z)$ must match when $\theta=0$, in which case $r=z$.

To find $A_l$ and $B_l$, the equation for $\mathbf{B}(z)$ must be written as an expansion in terms of $P_l$.

$$B_z(z) = \frac{\mu_oK}{2}\left[\frac{z+L}{\sqrt{b^2+(z+L)^2}}-\frac{z-L}{\sqrt{b^2+(z-L)^2}}\right]$$

$$B_z(z) = \frac{\mu_oK}{2}\left[\frac{z+L}{\sqrt{b^2+L^2-2zL+z^2}}-\frac{z-L}{\sqrt{b^2+L^2+2zL+z^2}}\right]$$

where $L\equiv 2h$. To write this in terms of $P_l$, one could use a Taylor series expansion as was done to find the potential far away from a collection of point charges. One result of that expansion is an equation for the generating function

$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-2xt+t^2}}=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}P_l(x)t^l$$

Using $\Phi_m(z)=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}z^lA_l$ and

$$B_z(z)=-\mu_o\frac{\partial \Phi_m}{\partial z} = -\mu_o\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}lz^{l-1}A_l$$

one should arrive at, defining $d=L/b$,

$$A_1=-1$$

$$A_2=0$$

$$A_3=\frac{P_1(d)/d-P_2(d)}{3}$$

$$A_4=0$$

$$A_5=\frac{P_3(d)/d-P_4(d)}{5}$$

$$...$$

or

$$P_l=\frac{P_{l-2}(d)/d-P_{l-1}(d)}{l}\quad l=3,5,...$$

$$P_l=0\quad l=2,4,...$$

Similar to electrostatic problems, the constant $A_o$ is arbitrary and cannot be fixed unless one is given $\Phi_m$ at a location in space.

'''Method 2.'''

See [http://dx.doi.org/10.1119/1.4906516], which uses a method that is similar to Method 1., but a general relationship was not derived.

'''Method 3.'''

Use $J_{\phi}=I\sin(\theta'-\theta_o)\delta(r'-r_o)/r_o$ with $r_o=\sqrt{z^2+b^2}$ and $tan\theta_o=b/z$ and follow the steps needed to arrive at Equation 5.44 of Jackson, which is the vector potential due to a ring in the $x-y$ plane and centered on the $z$-axis.  Your equation will be valid for a ring that is shifted by a distance $z$. Set $I=K_odz$ and integrate from $z=-L$ to $z=L$. One will need to use equation 5.47 and integration by parts.

2.

In the limit that $b/L\rightarrow 0$, the system is equivalent to a ring of current at the origin and one can compare this solution to the equation for a ring of current at the origin. In the limit that $b/L\rightarrow \infty$, the system is an infinite solenoid and the field should be constant inside of it.
