# HW 1 

Due Wednesday, January 29th before class starts.

Grading: Blue text is a comment. Red text or a red circle around blue text means points were taken off (this happens when I forget to switch pens).  Often I'll mark something wrong on your HW without explanation - I generally put the explanation for common errors in the solutions rather than writing the same comments many times. If my solutions do not clarify things, feel free to ask me a question.

## Continuous Charge Distributions 

A square non-conducting sheet of charge with side length $w$ has a uniform charge density of $\sigma_o$, lies in the $x-y$ plane, and is centered on the origin.

1. Find an integral or integrals that must be evaluated to find $\mathbf{E}(z)$, the electric field on the $z$-axis.
1. Evaluate the integral or integrals and show that for $z/w\ll 1$, $\mathbf{E}(z)$ reduces to the equation for an infinite non-conducting sheet of charge.

There are several ways to solve this problem. On can first find the field for a line of charge with a charge density of $\lambda$ and length $w$ that lies on the $x$-axis and is centered on the origin - the result is (see Griffiths 4th Edition example 2.2):

$$\mathbf{E}(z)=\frac{k\lambda w}{z\sqrt{z^2+w^2/4}}\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

Then integrate the field due to differential lines of charges. One needs to account for the fact that the $z$ in this equation will not be the same as the $z$ in this problem. If the differential lines of charge are in the $x$-$y$ plane and lie on the line $x=x'$, then replace the $z$ with $z^2+x'^2$ and use $\lambda = \sigma_odx'$, You can check your answer for this approach by using the result of the following approach after integration with respect to $x'$. 

$$\mathbf{E}_{dq'}(x,y,z) = \frac{dq'}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{\hat{\bf\char"0509}}{\char"0509^2}$$

A second approach requires two integrations. Start with

$$\mathbf{E}_{dq'}(x,y,z) = \frac{dq'}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{\hat{\bf\char"0509}}{\char"0509^2}$$

which expands to

$$\mathbf{E}_{dq'}(x,y,z) =\frac{dq'}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|^3}$$

(A third approach is to find the potential $\Psi_{dq'}(x,y,z) = dq'/(4\pi\epsilon_0\char"0509)$ and then use $\mathbf{E}=-\nabla \Psi$.)

and the general definitions

$$\mathbf{r}=x\hat{\mathbf{x}}+y\hat{\mathbf{y}}+z\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

$$\mathbf{r}'=x'\hat{\mathbf{x}}+y'\hat{\mathbf{y}}+z'\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

In this problem, $z'=0$ because all charges are in the $x-y$ plane. Using $dq' = \sigma_odx'dy'$, gives

$$\mathbf{E}(x,y,z) = \int_{-w/2}^{w/2}\int_{-w/2}^{w/2}\frac{ \sigma_odx'dy'}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{(x-x')\hat{\mathbf{x}}+(y-y')\hat{\mathbf{y}}+z\hat{\mathbf{z}}}{\big((x-x')^2+(y-y')^2+z^2\big)^{3/2}}$$

$\mathbf{E}(z)$ is obtained by setting $x=y=0$:

$$\mathbf{E}(z) = \int_{-w/2}^{w/2}\int_{-w/2}^{w/2}\frac{ \sigma_odx'dy'}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{-x'\hat{\mathbf{x}}+-y'\hat{\mathbf{y}}+z\hat{\mathbf{z}}}{\big(x'^2+y'^2+z^2\big)^{3/2}}$$

The $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{y}}$ integrals are zero because their integrands are odd functions. Many students argued they are zero "by symmetry". The word "symmetry" is too general because there are many types of symmetry. It is better to state what kind of symmetry: consider differential charges at $(x,y)$ and $(-x,-y)$ - their horizontal electric fields exactly cancel (ideally provide a diagram). The sheet of charge can be constructed by placing charges with canceling horizontal components and so the horizontal electric field is zero.

To simplify the integration for the $\hat{\mathbf{y}}$ term, define

$$I = \int_{-w/2}^{w/2}dy'\int_{-w/2}^{w/2}\frac{dx'}{(x'^2+a^2)^{3/2}}$$

where $a^2\equiv y'^2+z^2$ and then $E_z(z)=k\sigma_ozI$. This integral can be looked up or found using Mathematica or Wolfram Alpha. Some students reported "computation time exceeded" with Wolfram Alpha. This was probably caused by entering the double integral instead of doing a single integral at a time.

Integration with respect to $x'$ gives

$$I= \int_{-w/2}^{w/2}dy'\frac{x'}{a^2(x'^2+a^2)^{1/2}}\Bigg|_{-w/2}^{w/2}=\int_{-w/2}^{w/2}dy'\frac{w}{a^2(a^2+w^2/4)^{1/2}}$$

Using the earlier definition $a^2\equiv y'^2+z^2$ and a new definition $b^2\equiv z^2+w^2/4$ gives

$$I=\int_{-w/2}^{w/2}\frac{wdy'}{(y'^2+z^2)\sqrt{y'^2+b^2}}$$

This integral can be looked up and the result is (using $\tan^{-1}(u)=-\tan^{-1}(u)$)

$$I=\frac{4}{z}\tan^{-1}\left[\frac{w^2}{4z}\frac{1}{\sqrt{z^2+w^2/2}}\right]$$

The final result, using $E_z(z)=k\sigma_ozI$ defined earlier, is 

$$E_z(z)=\frac{\sigma_o}{\pi \epsilon_o}\tan^{-1}\left[\frac{w^2}{4z}\frac{1}{\sqrt{z^2+w^2/2}}\right]$$

For $z\ll w$, the argument to the inverse tangent is

$$\frac{w^2}{4z}\frac{1}{\sqrt{z^2+w^2/2}}\simeq \frac{w}{z}\frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}$$

so for $z \gt 0$ and $z\ll w$

$$E_z(z)\rightarrow\frac{\sigma_o}{\pi\epsilon_o}\tan^{-1}(+\infty) = \frac{\sigma_o}{2\epsilon_o}$$

For $z \lt 0$ and $z\ll w$

$$E_z(z)\rightarrow\frac{\sigma_o}{\pi\epsilon_o}\tan^{-1}(-\infty) = -\frac{\sigma_o}{2\epsilon_o}$$

and so the solution matches that for an infinite sheet of charge. Another problem one could ask is to show that for $z\gg w$, $E_z\rightarrow k\sigma_ow^2/z^2$ (far away, the sheet of charge appears as a charge $\sigma_ow^2$ at the origin). To show this, one would need to Taylor series expand the argument of the inverse tangent for small $w/z$.

## Representing $\rho$ Using $\delta$ and $\Theta$ 

1. Find the volume charge density $\rho$ in cylindrical coordinates in terms of $\delta$ and/or $\Theta$ for an infinitely long cylinder of radius $b$ with a charge density per unit length of $\lambda_o$ uniformly distributed on its surface. Assume that the cylinder's centerline is along the $z$-axis.
1. Repeat 1. assuming the cylinder is finite and extends from $z=-h/2$ to $z=h/2$.

''Optional''

3. Find the volume charge density $\rho$ in cylindrical coordinates in terms of $\delta$ and/or $\Theta$ for a uniformly charged disk of radius $b$ with charge density $\sigma_o$ that lies in the $x-y$ plane and is centered on the origin. Use $s$ for the radial coordinate in cylindrical coordinates.

4. Use identity 5. on page 26 of Jackson to convert this to spherical coordinates. Use $r$ for the radial coordinate in spherical coordinates.

1. $\rho = \frac{\lambda_o}{2\pi b}\delta(b-s)$

2. $\rho=\frac{\lambda_o}{2\pi b}\delta(b-s)\Big[\Theta(z+{h}/{2})-\Theta(z-{h}/{2})\Big]$

Some students assumed the charge was on the surface of the cylinder. In this case, the solution is

1. $\rho=\frac{\lambda_o}{\pi b^2}\Theta(b-s)$

2. $\rho=\frac{\lambda_o}{\pi b^2}\Theta(b-s)\Big[\Theta(z+{h}/{2})-\Theta(z-{h}/{2})\Big]$

----

3. $\rho=\frac{Q}{\pi b^2}\delta(z)\Theta(b-s)$

4. $\rho = \frac{Q}{\pi b^2}\frac{\delta(\theta-\pi/2)}{r}\Theta(b-r)$

## Gauss' Law 

1.## Infinite Line of Charge 

In general, in cylindrical coordinates, the electric field has the form

$$\mathbf{E}(s,\phi,z)=E_s(s,\phi,z)\hat{\mathbf{s}}+E_{\phi}(s,\phi,z)\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}+E_z(s,\phi,z)\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

where $s$ is the radial coordinate in cylindrical coordinates.

Consider an infinite line of charge with a uniform charge per unit length of $\lambda_o$ on the $z$-axis. The typical approach to finding that the equation for the electric field is

$$\mathbf{E}(s)=\frac{\lambda_o}{2\pi\epsilon_o}\frac{\hat{\mathbf{s}}}{s}$$

is to use a cylindrical Gaussian surface and Gauss' law. When using Gauss' law, one must make arguments for why

1. $E_s$ does not depend on $\phi$ and $z$

2. $E_z=0$

With these two justifications and Gauss' law, one arrives at only an equation for the radial component of the electric field, $E_s$. To complete the solution, one also needs to provide an argument for why 

3. $E_{\phi}=0$.

Derive the equation given above for the electric field using Gauss' law and explicitly state arguments for 1.-3.

I gave this problem because I have come to realize that students can use Gauss' law to find the electric field, but can't often answer conceptual questions about justifications for the steps needed to get the solution. The problem is that most textbooks don't emphasize the arguments or provide follow-up questions to test their understanding of the arguments and so students don't think too deeply about them.

Understanding the reasoning for this problem is critical for understanding the boundary condition equations

$$(\mathbf{E}_2-\mathbf{E}_1)\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} = \mathbf{E}_{2\perp}-\mathbf{E}_{1\perp} = \left[-\frac{\partial \Psi_2}{\partial n}+\frac{\partial \Psi_1}{\partial n}\right]_{n=0}=\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_o}$$

$$\mathbf{E}_{2\parallel}-\mathbf{E}_{2\parallel}=(\mathbf{E}_2-\mathbf{E}_1)\cdot \hat{\mathbf{t}}=0$$

where $n$ is the coordinate that is perpendicular to the boundary surface and outward to the volume enclosed by the boundary surface; $t$ is any coordinate parallel to the surface.

Several students used the solution for $\mathbf{E}$ given for arguments 1.-3., but this is circular reasoning. The point of the problem is to justify all of the steps needed to get to the solution.

I did not expect a solution with the level of detail in what follows. I generally looked for arguments or words that seemed close to something said below. I did not write extended comments on your solutions for statements that were wrong - you should be able to determine what was wrong by reading the following solution.

1. $E_s$ does not depend on $z$ because the charge distribution does not change if we shift the origin of $z$. Said another way, two people who solve this problem using a different location for $z=0$ should get the same result. $E_s$ does not depend on $\phi$ because if we rotate the charge distribution around the $z$-axis by $\phi$, the charge distribution does not change. Said another way, two people who solve the problem using a different $\phi=0$ line perpendicular to the line of charge should get the same answer. The same argument can be used to argue that $E_z$ and $E_{\phi}$ do not depend on $\phi$ and $z$, but this is not needed because in 2. and 3. they are found to be zero.

2. $E_z=0$ - Assume the line extends from $z=\pm L$. Adding the electric field due to a differential charge at $z$ to that from a differential charge at $-z$ gives an electric field that points in the $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ direction in the $x-y$ plane. An infinite line of charge can be created by letting $L\rightarrow\infty$. Or, for very small $s$, in the $x-y$ plane the line of charge appears infinite.

3. $E_{\phi}=0$ by the same argument as 2.

'''Detailed solution using 1.-3. and Gauss' law'''

$$\mathbf{E}(s,\phi,z)=E_s(s,\phi,z)\hat{\mathbf{s}}+E_{\phi}(s,\phi,z)\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}+E_z(s,\phi,z)\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

A Gaussian cylinder of radius $s$ and a height $h$ and centerline along the $z$-axis has three surfaces, with normals of $\hat{\mathbf{z}}$ on the top cap, $-\hat{\mathbf{z}}$ on the bottom cap, and $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ on the curved side.

$$\oint \mathbf{E}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}da = \int_{top\thinspacecap} \mathbf{E}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{z}} da +  \int_{bottom\thinspacecap} \mathbf{E}\cdot (-\hat{\mathbf{z}}) da + \int_{side}\mathbf{E}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} da$$

$\mathbf{E}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{z}} = E_z(s,\phi,z)$ and we have argued that $E_z=0$, so the first two integrals are zero.

$\mathbf{E}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} = E_s(s,\phi,z)$, so the last integral is, using $da=sdzd\phi$,

$$\int_{side}\mathbf{E}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} da = \int_{z=-h/2}^{h/2}\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi} E_s(s,\phi,z) sdz\thinspace d\phi$$

Because $E_s$ is independent of $z$, we can write

$$\int_{z=-h/2}^{h/2}\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi} E_s(s,\phi,z) sdz\thinspace d\phi=\int_{z=-h/2}^{h/2}\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi} E_s(s,\phi) sdz\thinspace d\phi=h\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi} E_s(s,\phi) sd\phi$$

Because $E_s$ is independent of $\phi$, we can write

$$h\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi} E_s(s,\phi) sd\phi=h\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi} E_s(s) sd\phi$$

Because $s$ and $\phi$ are orthogonal,

$$h\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi} E_s(s) sd\phi=hE_s(s) s\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi} d\phi=hE_s(s) s2\pi$$

Note that Gauss' law only gave us $E_s$ - we had to argue why $E_{\phi}$ and $E_z$ were zero. In addition, in order to do the integration in Gauss' law, we needed to provide additional justification for why $E_s$ could only depend on $s$. So this Gauss' law problem had two separate components: 1. arguments that reduce and simplify the general solution

$$\mathbf{E}(s,\phi,z)=E_s(s,\phi,z)\hat{\mathbf{s}}+E_{\phi}(s,\phi,z)\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}+E_z(s,\phi,z)\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

and then 2. evaluation of the integral in Gauss' law. I find that students that don't understand 1. are not able to articulate why a given Gaussian surface can't be used to find the electric field. For example, their answer to why a Gaussian sphere could not be used to find the electric field in this problem typically only involves an ambiguous statement about symmetry; "symmetry" is ambiguous because both a Gaussian sphere and a Gaussian cylinder have symmetry).

1.## Thin Cylinder of Charge 

Use Gauss' law and other arguments to find the electric field for an infinitely long cylinder of radius $b$ with a charge per unit length of $\lambda_o$ on its surface and its centerline along the $z$-axis. As in the previous problem, state all arguments needed to arrive at the final equation.

{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! align="left" |&nbsp;Solution

1. Same argument as the previous problem.

2. Assume the cylinder is created by placing infinite lines of charge parallel to the $z$-axis on the surface of a cylinder. One can use a diagram to show that at an arbitrary point in space, either inside or outside of the cylinder, one can find two lines of charge which have an electric field that sums to give an electric field that points in the $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ direction.  A diagram should be given to show this.

3. $E_{\phi}=0$ by the same argument as 2.

A common error is to note that Gauss' law with a Gaussian cylinder with radius less than $b$ has no charge enclosed, so

$$\oint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{a} = 0 \Rightarrow \mathbf{E}=0$$

inside the cylinder. The fact that the integral of a vector is zero does not imply the vector is zero. And without additional words, I can't tell if you understand that. The above claim is equivalent to the statement

$$\int f(x)\thinspace dx = 0 \Rightarrow f(x)=0$$

A better solution is to state that from 1.-3., we know $\mathbf{E}=E_s(s)\hat{\mathbf{s}}$. Using $d\mathbf{a}=\mathbf{\hat{s}}sdz\thinspace d\phi$ gives

$$\oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = 0 + 0 + \int_{side} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} =  \int_{side} E_s(s)\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}sd\phi=2\pi h s E_s(s)$$

where the two zero terms are due to the fact that we have argued $\mathbf{E}=E_s(s)\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ and so the dot product of this with the normal direction on the top and bottom caps is zero (see solution for the line of charge for full details).

For $s\lt b$, $\oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a}$ is zero, so for $s\ne 0$, $E_s(s)=0$. Gauss' law does not provide an answer for $s=0$ because we get $E_s=0/0$, but one can argue using pairs of lines of charge that the radial field must be zero for $s=0$. It is interesting to note that there is a purely geometrical approach to showing that the radial field is zero inside the cylinder. It is similar to the approach Newton used to show that the net force inside of a shell of mass is zero (he did not use calculus!).

To find $E_s$ outside of the cylinder, use

$$2\pi h s E_s(s) = \frac{Q_{encl}}{\epsilon_o} = \frac{\lambda_o h}{\epsilon_o}$$

## Divergence Theorem

1. radius $b/2$

As mentioned in class, this is somewhat of a simple problem but was given to motivate the use of the Dirac delta function. What I said in class is briefly summarized at the end.

1. The electric field is

$$\mathbf{E}(r \le b) = \frac{\rho_o}{3\epsilon_o}r\thinspace\mathbf{\hat{r}}=\frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\frac{r}{b^3}\mathbf{\hat{r}}$$

$$\mathbf{E}(r \ge b) = \frac{\rho_o}{3\epsilon_o}\frac{b^3}{r^2}\thinspace\mathbf{\hat{r}}=\frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\frac{1}{r^2}\mathbf{\hat{r}}$$

where $q=\rho_o\thinspace4\pi b^3/3$ was used.

2.

In the following,

$$A.\quad\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot (f(r)\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{r}})=\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r^2f(r)\right)$$

is used. This follows from the identity for the divergence in spherical coordinates.

Also, $\mathbf{E}_b$ is used for the piecewise electric field in 1. and $\mathbf{E}_p=(q/4\pi\epsilon_o)\hat{\mathbf{r}}/r^2$, corresponding the the electric field of a point charge $q$ at the origin.

<br/>
----
For $r\le b$ and $\mathcal{S}$ a spherical surface of radius $r$:

$$\oint_{\mathcal{S}}\mathbf{E}_b\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}\thinspace da =  \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^\pi\left(\frac{\rho_o}{3\epsilon_o}r\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{r}}\right)\cdot\hat{\mathbf{r}}\sin\theta\thinspace d\theta\thinspace d\phi=\frac{\rho_o}{\epsilon_o}\frac{4\pi r^3}{3}=\frac{q}{\epsilon_o}$$

The divergence of $\mathbf{E}_b$ is, using $A.$,

$$\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{E}_b= \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \left(\frac{\rho_o}{3\epsilon_o}r\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{r}}\right) = \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r^2\left(\frac{\rho_o}{3\epsilon_o}r\right)\right)= \frac{\rho_o}{\epsilon_o}$$

as expected from Gauss' law in differential form ($\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{E}=\rho/\epsilon_o$ with $\rho=\rho_o$). Therefore, for $r\le b$:

$$\int_{\mathcal{V}} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}_b\thinspace d^3x=\int_{\mathcal{V}} \frac{\rho_o}{\epsilon_o}\thinspace d^3x=\frac{\rho_o}{\epsilon_o}\frac{4\pi r^3}{3}=\frac{q}{\epsilon_o}$$

Conclusion: for $r\le b$,

$$\oint_{\mathcal{S}}\mathbf{E}_b\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}\thinspace da = \int_{\mathcal{V}} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}_b\thinspace d^3x$$
----
<br/>
----
For $r\gt b$ and $\mathcal{S}$ a spherical surface of radius $r$:

$$\oint_{\mathcal{S}}\mathbf{E}_b\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}\thinspace da =  \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^\pi\left(\frac{\rho_o}{3\epsilon_o}\frac{b^3}{r^2}\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{r}}\right)\cdot\hat{\mathbf{r}}\thinspacer^2\sin\theta\thinspace d\theta\thinspace d\phi = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^\pi\left(\frac{\rho_o}{3\epsilon_o}b^3\right)\sin\theta\thinspace d\theta\thinspace d\phi=\frac{\rho_o}{\epsilon_o}\frac{4\pi b^3}{3}=\frac{q}{\epsilon_o}$$

The divergence is

$$\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{E}_b=\frac{\rho_o b^3}{3\epsilon_o} \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \frac{\hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2} = \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r^2\left(\frac{\rho_o b^3}{3\epsilon_o}\frac{1}{r^2}\right)\right)=\frac{\rho_o b^3}{3\epsilon_o}\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(1\right)=0$$

also as expected from Gauss' law in differential form ($\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{E}=\rho/\epsilon_o$ with $\rho=0$). Important: the last equality in the above equation is only true when $r\ne 0$; when $r=0$, the result is $0/0$. This issue is considered later in this solution.

One must split the volume integral into two integrals, one for $r\le b$ and the other for $r\gt b$ to account for the divergence being different in the two regions. As shown earlier, in the region $r\gt b$, the divergence is zero. 

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\displaystyle\int_{\mathcal{V}} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}_b\thinspace d^3x& = & \
\displaystyle\int_{\mathcal{V_{r\le b}}} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}_b\thinspace d^3x & + &  \displaystyle\int_{\mathcal{V_{r\gt b}}} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}_b\thinspace d^3x\\
& = &  \displaystyle\int_{\mathcal{V_{r\le b}}} \frac{\rho_o}{\epsilon_o}\thinspace d^3x & + &  \displaystyle\int_{\mathcal{V_{r\gt b}}}0\thinspace d^3x\\
& = & \frac{\rho_o}{\epsilon_o}\frac{4\pi b^3}{3} & + & 0\\
& = & \frac{q}{\epsilon_o}
\end{array}
$$

Conclusion: for $r\gt b$,

$$\oint_{\mathcal{S}}\mathbf{E}_b\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}\thinspace da = \int_{\mathcal{V}} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}_b\thinspace d^3x$$

'''Motivation for this problem'''

I gave this problem as a lead-in/follow-up for my discussion of the motivation for the delta function. For a point charge, the integrand of

$$\int_{\mathcal{V}} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}_p\thinspace d^3x$$

with

$$\mathbf{E}_p=\frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\frac{\hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}$$

is zero everywhere except at the origin ($r=0$) where it is indeterminate in the form of $0/0$ because

$$
\displaystyle \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{E}_p = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_o} \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \frac{\hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2} = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(1\right) = \begin{cases}
0/0 & \text{if $r = 0$} \\ 
0 & \text{if $r\ne 0$}
\end{cases}
$$

However,

$$\oint_{\mathcal{S}}\mathbf{E}_p\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}\thinspace da =\frac{q}{\epsilon_o}$$

does not have an indeterminacy. Therefore, the divergence theorem

$$\int_{\mathcal{V}} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}_p\thinspace d^3x=\oint_{\mathcal{S}}\mathbf{E}_p\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}\thinspace da$$

applied to $\mathbf{E}$ for a point charge gives

$$\text{indeterminate integral}=\frac{q}{\epsilon_o}$$

In this problem, it has been shown that if a point charge $q$ is modeled as having a uniform density for $r\le b$ and having zero density for $r\gt b$, then the indeterminacy problem can be avoided and

$$\int_{\mathcal{V}} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}_b\thinspace d^3x = \oint_{\mathcal{S}}\mathbf{E}_b\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}\thinspace da$$

for all $r$ and for arbitrarily small (but non-zero) $b$ (but see also 'other notes' below).

Although the divergence theorem does not apply for $\mathbf{E}_p$, a common convention is to use it with the convention that

$$\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{E}_p=\frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \frac{\hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}=\frac{q}{\epsilon_o}\delta(\mathbf{\mathbf{r}})$$

where the function $\delta(\mathbf{\mathbf{r}})$ is zero everywhere except at $\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{0}$ and integrates to 1 when the volume of integration includes $\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{0}$.

$$\int_{\mathcal{V}} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}_b\thinspace d^3x=\int_{\mathcal{V}}\frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \frac{\hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}\thinspace d^3x=\int_{\mathcal{V}}\frac{q}{\epsilon_o}\delta(\mathbf{\mathbf{r}})\thinspace d^3x=\frac{q}{\epsilon_o}$$

That is,

$$\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \frac{\hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}=4\pi\delta(\mathbf{\mathbf{r}})$$

When you see the delta function used in an integration, you should think back to this problem and realize that the delta function is being used instead of modeling the electric field as a point charge $q$ as having a uniform density for $r\lt b$ and zero density for $r\gt b$.

Griffiths takes a different approach to motivating the introduction of the delta function. He notes that the indeterminate integral of the divergence

$$\int_{\mathcal{V}} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}_p\thinspace d^3x=\text{indeterminate integral}$$

must be equal to $q/\epsilon_o$ because of the divergence theorem:

$$\oint_{\mathcal{S}}\mathbf{E}_p\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}\thinspace da = \frac{q}{\epsilon_o}\quad\Rightarrow\quad\int_{\mathcal{V}} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}_p\thinspace d^3x=\frac{q}{\epsilon_o}$$

He then notes that $\hat{\mathbf{r}}/r^2$

has the property that its divergence

$$\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\frac{\hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}$$

1. is zero everywhere except at the origin (where it is interminate)
1. integrates to a constant ($4\pi$) over any volume $\mathcal{V}$ that includes $r=0$ (based on the assumption that the divergence theorem applies and resolves the indeterminacy)

That is, although

$$\int_{\mathcal{V}} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}\thinspace d^3x$$

has an indeterminate integrand at $r=0$, by the divergence theorem it must be equal to the surface integral, which is $\frac{q}{\epsilon_o}$. Therefore,

$$\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{E}_p=\frac{q}{\epsilon_o}\delta(\mathbf{\mathbf{r}})$$

where the function $\delta(\mathbf{r})$ is defined to be zero unless $r=0$ and integrates over a volume that includes $\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{0}$ to 1. This explanation is somewhat awkward because it asserts that the divergence theorem must be correct even though the field $\mathbf{E}_p$ does not satisfy the requirements for the divergence theorem to apply. The requirements are that the components of the vector field and their derivatives are continuous.

In summary, the integral

$$\int_{\mathcal{V}} f(\mathbf{r})\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}\thinspace d^3x$$

is indeterminant when $\mathbf{E}\sim \hat{\mathbf{r}}/r^2$ and $\mathcal{V}$ includes $\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{0}$. If we model a point charge as having a uniform density for $r\le b$, and zero density for $r\gt b$, where $b\ne 0$ is smaller than any length scale in the problem, the indeterminacy is removed. Instead of two integrations, one for $r \le b$ and the other for $r\gt b$, we can simply replace $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{E}_p$ with $(q/\epsilon_o)\delta(\mathbf{\mathbf{r}})$; the result of any integration will be the same.

----

A second motivation for using the delta function is that we often want to do an integral of the form

$$\int_{\mathcal{V}} f(\mathbf{r})\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}_p\thinspace d^3x$$

(Recall that $f(\mathbf{r})$ means $f(x,y,z)$). As before, integral is indeterminate because $\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot (\hat{\mathbf{r}}/r^2)$ is 0/0 at $r=0$. To work around this problem, we can again model the point charge as having a uniform density for $r\le b$ and zero density for $r\gt b$. Then 

$$\int_{\mathcal{V}} f(\mathbf{r})\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}\thinspace d^3x=\int_{\mathcal{V_{r\le b}}} f(\mathbf{r})\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}_b\thinspace d^3x+\int_{\mathcal{V_{r\gt b}}} f(\mathbf{r})\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}_b\thinspace d^3x$$

The second integral is identically zero because $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{E}_b=0$ for $r\gt b$. If $f(\mathbf{r})$ can be expanded as a Taylor series

$$f(\mathbf{r})\simeq f(\mathbf{0}) + \mathbf{r}\cdot\left[\boldsymbol{\nabla}f\thinspace\right]_{\mathbf{r}=0}\thickspace +\thickspace ...$$

then

\begin{array}{ll}
\displaystyle\int_{\mathcal{V_{r\le b}}} f(\mathbf{r})\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}\thinspace d^3x & = & \displaystyle\int_{\mathcal{V_{r\le b}}} \left(f(\mathbf{0})+\mathbf{r}\cdot\left[\boldsymbol{\nabla}f\thinspace\right]_{\mathbf{r}=0}\thickspace +\thickspace ...\right)\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}\thinspace d^3x\\
& = & \displaystyle\int_{\mathcal{V_{r\le b}}} f(\mathbf{0})\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}\thinspace d^3x+\displaystyle\int_{\mathcal{V_{r\le b}}} (\mathbf{r}\cdot\left[\boldsymbol{\nabla}f\thinspace\right]_{\mathbf{r}=0}\thickspace +\thickspace ...)\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}\thinspace d^3x\\
& = & f(\mathbf{0})\displaystyle\int_{\mathcal{V_{r\le b}}} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}\thinspace d^3x+\displaystyle\int_{\mathcal{V_{r\le b}}} \left(\mathbf{r}\cdot\left[\boldsymbol{\nabla}f\thinspace\right]_{\mathbf{r}=0}\thickspace +\thickspace ...\right)\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}\thinspace d^3x\\
& = & \frac{q}{\epsilon_o}f(\mathbf{0})\thickspace +\thickspace \frac{q}{\epsilon_o}\displaystyle\int_{\mathcal{V_{r\le b}}} \left(\mathbf{r}\cdot\left[\boldsymbol{\nabla}f\thinspace\right]_{\mathbf{r}=0}\thickspace +\thickspace ...\right)d^3x\\
\end{array}

The second and higher-order terms in the last equation approach zero as $b\rightarrow 0$.  To see this, note that for small enough $b$,

$$\frac{q}{\epsilon_o}\displaystyle\int_{\mathcal{V_{r\le b}}} f(\mathbf{r})\thinspace d^3x\rightarrow \frac{4\pi}{3}b^3\left<f(\mathbf{0})\right>$$

where the $\left<\right>$ is the average in $\mathcal{V}$ in a sphere of radius $b$. Therefore,

$$\frac{q}{\epsilon_o}\displaystyle\int_{\mathcal{V_{r\le b}}} \mathbf{r}\cdot\left[\boldsymbol{\nabla}f\thinspace\right]_{\mathbf{r}=0}\thinspace d^3x\xrightarrow[b\rightarrow 0]{} \frac{q}{\epsilon_o}\frac{4\pi}{3}b^3\left<\mathbf{r}\cdot\left[\boldsymbol{\nabla}f\thinspace\right]_{\mathbf{r}=0}\right>\xrightarrow[b\rightarrow 0]{}  0$$

The same argument applies to the higher-order terms in the Taylor series expansion.

Prior to the introduction of the delta function by Dirac in the 1930s, the above argument was used when an integral of the form

$$\displaystyle\int_{\mathcal{V}} f(\mathbf{r})\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}\thinspace d^3x$$

was encountered and $\mathbf{E}$ was that for a point charge and $\mathcal{V}$ that included the location of the point charge.

With the introduction of the Dirac delta, one can simply use $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{E}=\frac{q}{\epsilon_o}\delta(\mathbf{\mathbf{r}})$ to get the same result without needing to think about the above steps:

$$
\displaystyle \int_{\mathcal{V}} f(\mathbf{r})\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}\thinspace d^3x = \int_{\mathcal{V}} f(\mathbf{r})\frac{q}{\epsilon_o}\delta(\mathbf{\mathbf{r}})\thinspace d^3x = \begin{cases}
f(\mathbf{0})\frac{q}{\epsilon_o} & \text{if }\mathcal{V}\text{ includes } r = 0 \\ 
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

That is, using the delta function for the divergence of $\mathbf{E}$ due to a point charge will give us the same answer as if we had modeled the point charge as having a uniform density for $r\le b$, zero density for $r\gt b$, Taylor series expanded $f(\mathbf{r}$, and then let $b\rightarrow 0$.

'''Other notes'''

In the above, I showed that the divergence theorem gave the correct result for $\mathbf{E}_b$ and any $r$ by direct calculation. However, the divergence theorem

$$\oint_{\mathcal{S}}\mathbf{E}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}\thinspace da = \int_{\mathcal{V}} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}\thinspace d^3x$$

requires that within $\mathcal{V}$, the components of $\mathbf{E}$ and their derivatives are continuous. In $\mathbf{E}_b$, $E_r$ is continuous, but $\partial E_r/\partial r$ is not. So it appears that direct calculation for $r\gt b$ gave a result that was consistent with the divergence theorem even though the assumptions required to apply the divergence theorem are not satisfied. To see why this occurred, use the divergence theorem in the two parts of $\mathcal{V}$ where the divergence theorem applies for $\mathbf{E}_b$. 

First, consider the application of the divergence theorem for the volume between $r=0$ and $r=b$.

$$\int_{\mathcal{V_{r \le b}}} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}_b\thinspace d^3x = \int_\mathcal{S_{r=b}} \mathbf{E}_b\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}\thinspace da $$

The outward normal to $\mathcal{S_{r=b}}$ for $\mathcal{V_{r \le b}}$ is $+\hat{\mathbf{r}}$, so

$$I.\quad \int_{\mathcal{V_{r \le b}}} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}_b\thinspace d^3x =\int_\mathcal{S_{r=b}} \mathbf{E}_b\cdot \hat{\mathbf{r}}\thinspace da$$

Next, consider the application of the divergence theorem for the volume between $r=b$ and $r=2b$ (the result will apply to any $r\gt b$).

$$\int_{\mathcal{V_{b \le r \le 2b}}} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}_b\thinspace d^3x= \oint_\mathcal{S_{r=b}} \mathbf{E}_b\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}\thinspace da + \oint_\mathcal{S_{r=2b}} \mathbf{E}_b\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}\thinspace da$$

The outward normal to $\mathcal{S_{r=b}}$ for this volume is $-\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ and the outward normal to $\mathcal{S_{r=2b}}$ is $+\hat{\mathbf{r}}$, so

$$II.\quad \int_{\mathcal{V_{b \le r \le 2b}}} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}_b\thinspace d^3x=-\oint_\mathcal{S_{r=b}} \mathbf{E}_b\cdot \hat{\mathbf{r}}\thinspace da + \oint_\mathcal{S_{r=2b}} \mathbf{E}_b\cdot \hat{\mathbf{r}}\thinspace da$$

Using $I.$ and $II.$ with

$$\int_{\mathcal{V_{r \le 2b}}} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}_b\thinspace d^3x=\int_{\mathcal{V_{r \le b}}} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}_b\thinspace d^3x + \int_{\mathcal{V_{\thinspaceb \le r \le 2b}}} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}_b\thinspace d^3x $$

gives

$$\int_{\mathcal{V_{r \le 2b}}} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}_b\thinspace d^3x = \int_{\mathcal{S_{r=2b}}}\mathbf{E}_b\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}\thinspace da$$

(The surface integrals at $r=b$ cancel because their normal directions are in opposite directions.)

## Lecture Follow-Up Questions 

An uncharged conducting sphere of radius $2b$ is centered on the origin and has a spherical cavity of radius $b$ that is also centered on the origin.

1. If a charge of $+q$ is at the origin, explain why the surfaces at $r=2b$ and $r=b$ each have a net charge of $+q$ and $-q$, respectively, and not, say, $+q/2$ and $-q/2$.
1. Repeat this question for the case where the inner surface of the cavity is not spherical (but the charge at the origin is still in a cavity)

Several students used the justification of "E is zero inside a conductor". This is not a full justification. If someone said "$+q/2$ and $-q/2$ give E of zero inside the conductor", your proof that this statement is wrong would require using Gauss' law.

1.

Gauss' law using a sphere of radius $b\lt r\lt 2b$:

$$\oint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{a} = \frac{Q_{encl}}{\epsilon_o} = \frac{q + q_{r=b}}{\epsilon_o}$$

LHS is zero because field is zero inside conductor. So $q_{r=b}=-q$.

2. 

Same approach but the surface is not a sphere but rather a surface that is always inside conductor; $q_{r=b}=-q$.

## Green's Reciprocity Theorem 

For discrete charges, Green's Reciprocity Theorem for $N$ charges is

$$\sum_{i=1}^{N}\Phi_i q'_i=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\Phi'_i q_i$$

Consider charges $q_1,q_2$, and $q_3$ at locations $x_1,x_2$, and $x_3$, respectively, on the $x$-axis. At these locations, the potentials are $\Phi_1,\Phi_2,$ and $\Phi_3$, respectively.

If a new system of charges $q'_1,q'_2$, and $q'_3$ is created by placing them at the same locations $x_1,x_2$, and $x_3$, respectively, the potentials at these locations are $\Phi'_1,\Phi'_2,$ and $\Phi'_3$, respectively.

Show that 

$$\sum_{i=1}^{3}\Phi_i q'_i=\sum_{i=1}^{3}\Phi'_i q_i$$

{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! align="left" |&nbsp;Answer
|-
|

Using

$$\Phi_i=\sum_{\substack{j=1\\j\ne i}}^N \frac{q_j}{|x_j-x_i|}$$

gives, for $N=3$, the left-hand-side terms in $\sum_{i=1}^{3}\Phi_i q'_i=\sum_{i=1}^{3}\Phi'_i q_i$

\begin{array}{rc}
\Phi_1q'_1 & = & 0 & + &  \frac{q_2q'_1}{|x_2-x_1|} & + & \frac{q_3q'_1}{|x_3-x_1|}  \\
\Phi_2q'_2 & = & \frac{q_1q'_2}{|x_1-x_2|} & + & 0 & + & \frac{q_3q'_2}{|x_3-x_2|} \\
\Phi_3q'_3 & = & \frac{q_1q'_3}{|x_1-x_3|} & + & \frac{q_2q'_3}{|x_2-x_3|} & + & 0 &  \\
\end{array}

The right-hand-side terms in $\sum_{i=1}^{3}\Phi_i q'_i=\sum_{i=1}^{3}\Phi'_i q_i$ can be expanded as

\begin{array}{rc}
\Phi'_1q_1 & = & 0 & + &  \frac{q'_2q_1}{|x_2-x_1|} & + & \frac{q'_3q_1}{|x_3-x_1|}  \\
\Phi'_2q_2 & = & \frac{q'_1q_2}{|x_1-x_2|} & + & 0 & + & \frac{q_2q'_3}{|x_3-x_2|} \\
\Phi'_3q_3 & = & \frac{q'_1q_3}{|x_1-x_3|} & + & \frac{q'_2q_3}{|x_2-x_3|} & + & 0 &  \\
\end{array}

Noting that $|x_i-x_j|=|x_j-x_i|$ and the sum of the matrix elements for both cases is equal gives the result. (To see this, note that adding terms row-wise in the first matrix gives the same ordering of terms as when the elements in the second matrix are added column-wise.)

Alternatively, one can note that

$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} q_i\Phi'_i = \sum_{i=1}^{N} q_i \sum_{\substack{j=1\\j\ne i}}^N \frac{q'_j}{|x_j-x_i|}$$

$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} q'_i\Phi_i = \sum_{i=1}^{N} q'_i \sum_{\substack{j=1\\j\ne i}}^N \frac{q_j}{|x_i-x_j|}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{\substack{j=1\\j\ne i}}^N \frac{ q'_i q_j}{|x_i-x_j|}=\sum_{j=1}^{N}\sum_{\substack{i=1\\i\ne j}}^N \frac{ q'_i q_j}{|x_i-x_j|}=\sum_{j=1}^{N}q_j\sum_{\substack{i=1\\i\ne j}}^N \frac{ q'_i}{|x_i-x_j|}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}q_i\sum_{\substack{j=1\\j\ne i}}^N \frac{ q'_i}{|x_i-x_j|}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}q_i\sum_{\substack{j=1\\j\ne i}}^N \frac{ q'_i}{|x_j-x_i|}$$

Where the fact that the indices used in the sums can be swapped was used along with $|x_i-x_j|=|x_j-x_i|$.

1.

Unprimed system is plate in $x-y$ plane at $\Phi=0$ and plate in $z=d$ plane at $\Phi=V_o$.

Unprimed system is plate in $x-y$ plane at $\Phi'=0$, plate in $z=d$ plane at $\Phi'=0$, and point charge at $x_o$.

One can use the result from problem 1.11 of Jackson or

$$\int_{all\thinspace }\rho'\Phi\thinspace d^3x = \int_{all\thinspace }\rho\Phi'\thinspace d^3x$$

and split the charge density into surface and volume charge densities $\sigma$ and $\rho_v$.

$$\int_{all\thinspace }\rho_v'\Phi\thinspace d^3x+\int_{\mathcal{S}}\sigma'\Phi\thinspace da = \int_{all\thinspace }\rho_v\Phi'\thinspace d^3x+\int_{\mathcal{S}}\sigma\Phi'\thinspace da$$

First term on RHS is zero because $\rho=0$ (conductor). Second term on RHS is zero becuase $\Phi'=0$ on surface.

First term on LHS reduces to $\Phi(x_o)$ becuase $\rho_v'=q\delta(x-x_o)\delta(y)\delta(z)$ (the notation $\rho_v'=q\delta(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x_o}')$ is also acceptable; this gives $\Phi(\mathbf{x_o})$, which is the same things as $\Phi(x_o)$ notationally). Second term on LHS is composed of integrals on top and bottom surfaces (and the assumption that all charges are on these surfaces and not on far-away surfaces; this is discussed below), but $\Phi=0$ on bottom surface. This leaves integral over upper surface ($u$) over which $\Phi=V_o$.

$$\int_{\mathcal\thinspaceu}\sigma'\Phi_u\thinspace da=\Phi_u\int_{\mathcal\thinspaceu}\sigma'\thinspace da=V_oQ_u$$

The potential between the plates in the unprimed system is

$$\Phi(x)=V_o\frac{x}{d}$$

giving

$$Q_u=-q\frac{x_o}{d}$$

One can reverse the potentials on the unprimed system to arrive at the charge $Q_l$ on the lower primed surface

$$Q_l=q\left(\frac{x_o}{d}-1\right)$$

Note also that the assumption that the total charge in the universe is zero

$$Q_u+Q_l+q=0$$

could have also been used to find $Q_l$. 

----

Note: In the solution, I assumed all free charges were on the upper and lower surfaces and there were no charges on far-away surfaces; this statement is justified post hoc by uniqueness and because computing $Q_u$ and $Q_l$ in this way gave $Q_u+Q_l+q=0$. To avoid this assumption, one would need to use equation 1.35 of Jackson with the volume being the volume between the plates. Curiously, in problem 1.11, Jackson suggests using equation 1.35 to come up with what he calls Green's reciprocation theorem, seemingly so it could be applied in problem 1.12. However, the equation in problem 1.11 does not directly apply because the surface of the volume between the plates is not all conductor (only top and bottom parts of the volume are conductors, the sides of this volume are not). One is left with having to use equation 1.35 and the argument that because the problem is 1-dimensional, the derivatives of the potential with respect to the normal on the side surfaces of the volume are zero.

----

2.

The procedure here is nearly identical to part 1. The major exception is that the potential between the sphere in the unprimed system is

$$\Phi(r)=\frac{b}{c-b}V_o\left(\frac{c}{r}-1\right)$$

which can be found by solving the boundary value problem or by assuming a charge $Q$ on the outer sphere and $-Q$ on the inner sphere and using Gauss' law to find $E_r$ and then $V(c)-V(b)=-\int_b^cE_r\thinspace dr$ (the $Q$ will cancel).

$$Q_{r=b}=-\frac{qb}{c-b}V_o\left(\frac{c}{r_o}-1\right)$$

$$Q_{r=c}=+\frac{qc}{c-b}V_o\left(\frac{b}{r_o}-1\right)$$

Many students used the explicit form of the delta in spherical coordinates, but one could just as well have used  $\rho_v'=q\delta(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r_o}')$.

## Green's Identity Derivation 

In deriving his identities, Green said: "Consider the divergence of a scalar function $f$ multiplied by a vector function $\mathbf{A}$".

Show that

$$\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot (f\mathbf{A}) = f(\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{A}) + \mathbf{A}\cdot(\mathbf{\nabla}f)$$

Then show

$$\int_{\mathcal{V}} f(\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{A})\thinspace d^3x = -\int_{\mathcal{V}}\mathbf{A}\cdot(\mathbf{\nabla}f)\thinspace d^3x+\oint_{\mathcal{S}} f\mathbf{A}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}\thinspace da$$

where $\mathcal{V}$ is the volume enclosed by the surface $\mathcal{S}$, $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ is the normal to a differential area element $da$ on $\mathcal{S}$, and $d^3x$ is a differential volume element.

1. 

Can be shown by writing $\boldsymbol{\nabla}$ and $\mathbf{A}$ in cartesian coordinates.

2.

The divergence theorem

$$\oint_{\mathcal{S}}\mathbf{U}\cdot d\mathbf{a}=\int_{\mathcal{V}}\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{U}\thinspace d^3x$$

using $\mathbf{U}=f\mathbf{A}$ on the LHS and $\mathbf{U}=f(\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{A}) + \mathbf{A}\cdot(\mathbf{\nabla}f)$ the the RHS gives

$$\oint_{\mathcal{S}}f\mathbf{A}\cdot d\mathbf{a}=\int_{\mathcal{V}}\Big[\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot f(\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{A}) + \mathbf{A}\cdot(\mathbf{\nabla}f)\big]\thinspace d^3x$$

and rearrangement gives

$$\int_{\mathcal{V}} f(\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{A})\thinspace d^3x = -\int_{\mathcal{V}}\mathbf{A}\cdot(\mathbf{\nabla}f)\thinspace d^3x+\oint_{\mathcal{S}} f\mathbf{A}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}\thinspace da$$

Note that when $\mathbf{A}=A_x(x)\hat{\mathbf{x}}$, $f=f(x)$, and $\mathcal{V}$ is a cube, this reduces to the integration by parts formula.

## Jackson Equation 1.42 

Before stating Equation 1.42, Jackson (3rd edition) notes that with Equation 1.35 and 1.39, it is simple to obtain a generalization of Equation 1.36.

Show the "simple" steps need to arrive at Equation 1.42.

{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! align="left" |&nbsp;Solution
|-
|
Equation 1.35

$$\int_V \left(\phi\nabla^2\psi -\psi\nabla^2\phi\right)d^3x=\oint_S\left(\phi\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial n}-\psi\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n}\right) da$$

Equation 1.39

$$\nabla'^2G(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')=-4\pi\delta(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}')$$

were the prime means the partial derivatives are taken with respect to primed coordinates.

Using

$$\phi=\Phi(\mathbf{x})$$

$$\psi=G(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')=\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}+F(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')$$

and

$$\nabla^2\Phi=-\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_o}$$

gives

$$\int_{\mathcal{V}} \left(\Phi(\mathbf{x})\nabla^2G(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}') + G(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')\frac{\rho(\mathbf{x})}{\epsilon_o}\right)d^3x=\oint_{\mathcal{S}}\left(\Phi(\mathbf{x})\frac{\partial G(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')}{\partial n}-G(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')\frac{\partial \Phi(\mathbf{x})}{\partial n}\right) da$$

We want the result after integration to depend on $\mathbf{x}$, so change the integration variable to be primed. The derivatives must also be changed to be primed and $G(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')$ must be replaced with $G(\mathbf{x}',\mathbf{x})$.

$$\int_{\mathcal{V}} \left(\Phi(\mathbf{x}')\nabla'^2G(\mathbf{x}',\mathbf{x}) + G(\mathbf{x}',\mathbf{x})\frac{\rho(\mathbf{x}')}{\epsilon_o}\right)d^3x'=\oint_{\mathcal{S}}\left(\Phi(\mathbf{x}')\frac{\partial G(\mathbf{x}',\mathbf{x})}{\partial n'}-G(\mathbf{x}',\mathbf{x})\frac{\partial \Phi(\mathbf{x}')}{\partial n'}\right) da'$$

$$\nabla'^2G(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')=\nabla'^2\left(\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}\right) + \nabla'^2F = -4\pi\delta(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}')+0$$

using equation 1.35 and the constraint $\nabla'^2F=0$. Finally, using

$$\int_{\mathcal{V}}\Phi(\mathbf{x}')\left(-4\pi\delta(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}')\right)d^3x'=-4\pi\Phi(\mathbf{x})$$

and rearrangement gives 

$$\Phi(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\int_{\mathcal{V}}G(\mathbf{x}',\mathbf{x})\rho(\mathbf{x}')d^3x'+\frac{1}{4\pi}\oint_S\left(G(\mathbf{x}',\mathbf{x})\frac{\partial \Phi(\mathbf{x}')}{\partial n'}-\Phi(\mathbf{x}')\frac{\partial G(\mathbf{x}',\mathbf{x})}{\partial n'}\right) da'$$

To get equation 1.42, one must justify

$$G(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')=G(\mathbf{x}',\mathbf{x})$$

For a general function, say, $g(x,y) = xy^2$, $g(x,y) = xy^2\ne g(y,x) = yx^2$. Showing this is non-trivial and Jackson problem 1.14 gives a suggestion for the proof, and a footnote on page 40 gives a reference of the proof for 1.14(b). So ideally one would have cited the statement on page 40 of Jackson to justify the use of $G(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')=G(\mathbf{x}',\mathbf{x})$.

## Capacitance 

Compute the capacitance for three spherical shells of radius $b$, $c$, and $d$ all with the same center and $b \lt c \lt d$.

{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! align="left" |&nbsp;Solution
|-
|

Place $Q$ on the surface at $r=d$ and $-Q$ on the surface at $r=b$. This is the procedure to find the capacitance in general. One does not put charges on the inner shell - the capacitance is the formula for the ratio of the charge on the surfaces you connect the batteries to. 

Due to the charges at $r=d$ and $r=b$, a charge $+Q$ will appear on the inner surface of the shell at $r=c$ and a charge $-Q$ will appear on its outer surface. See first problem in this homework for the justification.

The result is $C={4\pi\epsilon_0\over\left({1\over b} - {1\over d}\right)}$.

This could be derived using the $1/C_{eq}=1/C_1+1/C_2$ and the formula for the capacitance for two concentric spherical shells. Ideally, you know how to also get the result using the method discussed in class in which one computes the electric field between $b$ and $c$ and $c$ and $d$ using Gauss' law arguments and sets the integral of this field from $b$ to $d$ equal to $V$ and then solves for $V/Q$. 

One student correctly noted that the above result requires the assumption that the thickness of the inner shell is zero, and a conductor must have a thickness (otherwise there would be no charge separation on the inner shell that allows the electric field to be zero inside of it; in order for a conductor to have a zero field "inside", it must have an "inside"). If you compute the capacitance assuming the inner shell has an inner radius of $c_i$ and outer radius of $c_o$, you'll get a result for the capacitance that approaches the answer given above in the limit that $c_o\rightarrow c_i$.

# HW 3 

## Alternative Derivation of Reciprocity for Continuous $\rho$ 

Consider the integral

$$I = \int_{\mathcal V} \mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{E}'d^3x$$

1. Use $\mathbf{E}=-\mathbf{\nabla}\Phi$ and the result derived in [[S2020/Problems#Green.27s_Identity_Derivation|HW#2, problem 4]] to re-write this equation in terms of a volume integral + a surface integral.

2. Repeat 1. using $\mathbf{E}'=-\mathbf{\nabla}\Phi'$

3. Show how the results from 1. and 2. can be used to show

$$\int_{all\thinspace }\Phi'\rho\thinspace d^3x = \int_{all\thinspace }\Phi\rho'\thinspace d^3x$$

which was a result derived in class last week using the discrete form of Green's reciprocity theorem.

From HW #2, derived using a vector identity + the divergence theorem (Several students did not cite this result from HW #2. As a general rule, if a step is not obvious, the justification or a citation to an equation in a book needs to be provided; otherwise it can appear as if you are omitting justification because you don't know what it is.):

$$\int_{\mathcal{V}} f(\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{A})\thinspace d^3x = -\int_{\mathcal{V}}\mathbf{A}\cdot(\mathbf{\nabla}f)\thinspace d^3x+\oint_{\mathcal{S}} f\mathbf{A}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}\thinspace da$$

Using $f=\Phi$ and $\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{E}'$ in this equation gives

$$I = \int_{\mathcal V} \mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{E}'d^3x\int_{\mathcal{V}} \Phi(\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{E}')\thinspace d^3x = -\int_{\mathcal{V}}\mathbf{E}'\cdot(\mathbf{\nabla}\Phi)\thinspace d^3x+\oint_{\mathcal{S}} \Phi\mathbf{E}'\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}\thinspace da$$

Using $f=\Phi'$ and $\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{E}$ in this equation gives

$$I = \int_{\mathcal V} \mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{E}'d^3x=\int_{\mathcal{V}} \Phi'(\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{E})\thinspace d^3x = -\int_{\mathcal{V}}\mathbf{E}\cdot(\mathbf{\nabla}\Phi')\thinspace d^3x+\oint_{\mathcal{S}} \Phi'\mathbf{E}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}\thinspace da$$

Equating these two equations gives

$$-\int_{\mathcal{V}}\mathbf{E}'\cdot(\mathbf{\nabla}\Phi)\thinspace d^3x+\oint_{\mathcal{S}} \Phi\mathbf{E}'\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}\thinspace da = -\int_{\mathcal{V}}\mathbf{E}\cdot(\mathbf{\nabla}\Phi')\thinspace d^3x+\oint_{\mathcal{S}} \Phi'\mathbf{E}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}\thinspace da$$

If the volume is be all space, the area of $\mathcal{S}$ becomes infinite. However, if all of the charges that make up $\rho$ and $\rho'$ are confined to be in a sphere centered at the origin with a finite radius, then as the radius of $\mathcal{S}\rightarrow\infty$, $\mathbf{E}\rightarrow \hat{\mathbf{r}}/r^2$ and $\Phi\rightarrow 1/r$ and similar for $\mathbf{E}'$ and $\Phi'$.  (You needed to provide some sort of justification similar to this in you solution - saying the potential and field approaches zero is not sufficient because the surface becomes infinite and you are left with $\infinity\cdot 0$). So for large $\mathcal{S}$, corresponding to large $r$,

$$\oint_{\mathcal{S}} \Phi\mathbf{E}'\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}\thinspace da\simeq\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{\pi}\frac{QQ'}{r^3}\thinspacer^2\sin\theta\thinspace d\theta\thinspace d\phi=4\pi \frac{QQ'} r$$

Where $Q$ and $Q'$ are the total charges in the unprimed and primed system respectively.

## Method of Images Review 

Consider the problem of finding the potential $\Phi(\mathbf{x})$ above a grounded and infinite conducting plane when a point charge $q$ is placed above it. (Recall that $\Phi(\mathbf{x})$ is short-hand for $\Phi(x,y,z)$.) 

Assume the conducting plane is in the $x$-$y$ plane and the charge $q$ is placed at at $(x,y,z)=(0,0,z_o)$ 

Due to the point charges, a surface charge density will appear on the conducting plane. To calculate $\Phi(\mathbf{x})$, one needs to know this surface charge density. However, we can't use the direct integration formula used for continuous charge distributions

$$\Phi(\mathbf{x})= \Phi_q(\mathbf{x}) + \int_{plane}\frac{k\thinspace\sigma(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}\thinspace da'$$

because we don't know $\sigma$. ($\Phi_q(\mathbf{x})$ is the potential due to the point charge $q$).

To find $\Phi(\mathbf{x})$, one finds the potential due to a alternantive charge configuration: a point charge $q$ at $(x,y,z) = (0,0,z_o)$ and a point charge $-q$ at $(x,y,z) = (0,0,-z_o)$.

1. Find $\Phi(x,y,z)$ for the alternative charge configuration.
1. Explain why this $\Phi(\mathbf{x})$ is the solution to the original problem.
1. Compute $\partial \Phi(x,y,z)/\partial z$ when $z=0$.

{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"

2. From 1.9 of Jackson, if a potential satisfies Poisson's equation in a volume and Dirichlet boundary conditions on the enclosing surface, then it is a unique solution. 

Here the surface is the $z=0$ plane and a hemispherical surface of a large radius above this plane.

Both the original and alternative charge configuration satisfy the same Poisson's equation. In the first case,

$$\nabla^2\Phi=-q\delta(\mathbf{r}-z_o\hat{\mathbf{z}})$$

in the alternative case,

$$\nabla^2\Phi=-q\delta(\mathbf{r}-z_o\hat{\mathbf{z}})+q\delta(\mathbf{r}+z_o\hat{\mathbf{z}})$$

However, because the volume is for $z\gt 0$, the second delta term is zero and so the potential for the alternative case satisfies the same Poisson equation as the original problem.

The potential for the alternative charge configuration satisfies the boundary conditions $\Phi(x,y,0)=0$ and $\Phi=0$ on a half-sphere of large radius. Because solutions to Poisson's equation in a volume bounded by a surface with given boundary conditions are unique, the potential to the alternative problem is the solution for the original problem.

## Point Charge above Infinite Plane 

A point charge $q$ is at a distance $d$ above an infinite and grounded conducting plane. Use the method of images to find:

1. the potential $\Psi(\mathbf{r})$ in the region above the plane;
1. $\nabla^2\Psi$ in the region above the plane;
1. the surface charge density induced on the plane (also verify that this surface charge density gives the expected potential if $\Psi(\mathbf{x})=(1/4\pi\epsilon_0)\int dq/|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'}|$ is used to compute the potential);
1. the force between the plane and the charge using Coulomb's law for the force between $q$ and its image $q'$;
1. the total force acting on the plane by integrating $\sigma^2/2\epsilon_0$ over the whole plane;
1. the work necessary to remove the charge $q$ from its position to infinity;
1. the potential energy between the charge $q$ and its image (compare the answer the work computed in the previous part and discuss).

1.

$$\Psi = \frac{kq}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+(z-d)^2}}-\frac{kq}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+(z+d)^2}}$$

Justification given in previous problem.

2. 

Using the fact that

$$\nabla^2\left[\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}\right] = -4\pi\delta(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}')$$

gives

$$\nabla^2\Psi=-q\delta(x)\delta(y)\delta(z-d)+q\delta(x)\delta(y)\delta(z+d)$$

For $z\gt 0$, $\delta(z+d)=0$, so

$$\nabla^2\Psi=-q\delta(x)\delta(y)\delta(z-d)$$

Many students computed $\nabla^2\Psi$ and found it to be zero. This is not necessary as we know that the potential $\Psi(\mathbf{x})$ for a point charge at $\mathbf{x}'$, $\nabla^2\Psi = 0$ except at $\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{x}'$. At $\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{x}'$, $\nabla^2\Psi=0/0$ and the resolution of this indeterminacy using the delta function was explored in an earlier homework by modeling a point charge as a sphere of uniform charge density and a vanishing radius.

3. 

At the surface of a conductor, from Gauss' law,

$$\sigma=\epsilon_o\mathbf{E}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}$$

where $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ is the normal to the surface and $\mathbf{E}$ is the field on the surface. For the plane, $\hat{\mathbf{n}}= \hat{\mathbf{z}}$, so

$$\mathbf{E}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}=-(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\Psi)\cdot\hat{\mathbf{z}}=-\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial z}$$

$$\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial z}=\frac{-(z-d)kq}{(x^2+y^2+(z-d)^2)^{3/2}}-\frac{-(z+d)kq}{(x^2+y^2+(z-d)^2)^{3/2}}=\frac{2dkq}{(x^2+y^2+(z-d)^2)^{3/2}}$$

At the surface, $z=0$, so

$$\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial z}\Bigg|_{z=0}=\frac{2kqd}{(x^2+y^2+d^2)^{3/2}}$$

giving

$$\sigma=-\frac{q}{2\pi}\frac{d}{(x^2+y^2+d^2)^{3/2}}$$

Using

$$\Psi(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\int \frac{dq}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'}|}$$ 

with $dq=\sigma dx'dy'$ and $|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'}|=\sqrt{(x-x')^2+(y-y')^2+z^2}$ gives the required integral to find the potential due to the surface charges:

$$\Psi(x,y,z)=-\frac{qd}{8\pi\epsilon_0}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dx'dy'\frac{1}{((x-x')^2+(y-y')^2+z^2)^{1/2}}\frac{1}{(x'^2+y'^2+d^2)^{3/2}}$$

As mentioned on Piazza, we have not covered the technique for finding $\Psi(\mathbf{x}$, so find the potential for $z=0$ only, set $x=y=0$, giving

$$\Psi(0,0,z)=-\frac{qd}{8\pi\epsilon_0}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dx'dy'\frac{1}{(x'^2+y'^2+z^2)^{1/2}}\frac{1}{(x'^2+y'^2+d^2)^{3/2}}$$

Using polar coordinates with $s'^2=x'^2+y'^2$,

$$\Psi(z)=-\frac{qd}{8\pi\epsilon_0}\int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{0}^{2\pi}s'ds'd\phi'\frac{1}{(s'^2+z^2)^{1/2}}\frac{1}{(s'^2+d^2)^{3/2}}$$

Integration over $\phi'$ gives

$$\Psi(z)=-\frac{qd}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\int_{0}^{\infty}s'ds'\frac{1}{(s'^2+z^2)^{1/2}}\frac{1}{(s'^2+d^2)^{3/2}}$$

Using $u^2=s'^2+z^2$ gives

$$\Psi(z)=-\frac{qd}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\int_{z}^{\infty}u\thinspace du'\frac{1}{(u^2)^{1/2}}\frac{1}{(u^2-z^2+d^2)^{3/2}}$$

$$\Psi(z)=-\frac{qd}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\int_{z}^{\infty}\text{sign}(u)\thinspace du'\frac{1}{(u^2-z^2+d^2)^{3/2}}$$

where $\text{sign}(u)=u/|u|$. Using an integral table, $\int du(u^2+c^2)^{-3/2}= u/(c^2 \sqrt{c^2 + u^2})$ with $c^2\equiv d^2-z^2$ gives, for both signs of $z$,

$$\Psi(z)=-\frac{qd}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\left[\frac{1}{d^2-z^2}-\frac{|z|}{|d|(d^2-z^2)}\right]$$

Most students did not have absolute value signs in their solution because they did not use $\sqrt{z^2}=|z|$. Getting the absolute value in the answer below requires consideration of $z\gt 0$ and $z\lt 0$ cases in the above (in general, this would matter, but it does not matter for this problem because we are considering only $z\gt 0$). Using this fact and the fact that $d\gt 0$ by definition, so $|d|=d$, gives

$$\Psi(z)=-\frac{qd}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{1}{|z|+d}$$

This is the potential for the charges on the surface above and below the surface; it is symmetric around $z=0$ as expected. For $z\gt 0$, $|z|+d=|z+d|$, so we have recovered the second term in the potential for part 1. When $z \lt 0$, this potential is equal and opposite to the potential for the point charge above the plane, giving a zero potential for $z\lt 0$.

4.

The force is

$$F=\frac{kq}{(2d)^2}$$

5.

Integration should give the same force as 4.

6.

The downward force as a function of the position of the charge above the plane is

$$F=\frac{kq^2}{(2z)^2}$$

Integrating this force

$$W_{ext}= \int\mathbf{F}_{ext}\cdot d\mathbf{l} = \int_{z=d}^{\infty}\frac{kq^2dz}{(2z)^2}=\frac{kq}{4d}$$

Note that one should get a positive answer for the work required to remove the charge - the external force on the charge $q$ is in the same direction of its movement.

7. The potential energy of $q$ and its image is

$$U=-\frac{kq^2}{2d}$$

which corresponds to minus the work required to move charge $q$ out with $q'$ fixed: $\Delta U = U_f-U_i = 0 - U_i = W_{ext}$.

The discrepancy is due to the fact that in part 7., we assumed that the image charge (or equivalently, the induced charges on the plane) was fixed. As $q$ is moved upwards, the induced charge on the sheet decreases and so the force on $q$ due to the induced charges will be less than that assumed in 7.  To see that the force implied by use of 7. is 2x that in 6., compute the force using $dU/dz$ with $U$ from 7.: $U=-kq^2/(2z)$.

Another way at arriving at the same result as 6. is to consider $\int E^2 d^3x$ with a volume of integration of $z\gt 0$. If one uses a volume of integration of all space, then one arrives at the result in 7.

Many students essentially copied an online solution (without citation!) that states "The potential energy is twice the work required to move the particle to infinity. The reason they don't match is because the image particle is not a real particle. We must remember that there are actually no fields within the conductor. The potential energy calculation above is counting the energy of the fields in the conductor, which don't actually exist."

The problem with the statement of "We must remember that there are actually no fields within the conductor" is that no statement is made about why the calculation in 7. counts the energy of the fields in the conductor (the $z\lt 0$ region).  The other problem is copying an answer without citation.

Using the divergence theorem for a vector field $\mathbf{A}$ that can be written in the form $\mathbf{A}=\phi \nabla\psi$, show that

$$\int_\mathcal{V} \left(\phi\nabla^2\psi + \nabla\phi\boldsymbol{\cdot}\nabla\psi\right)d^3x=\oint_\mathcal{S}\phi\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial n} da$$

where $\phi(\mathbf{x})$ and $\psi(\mathbf{x})$ are scalar functions and $\mathcal{S}$ is the surface of the volume $\mathcal{V}$.

$$\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot (f\mathbf{F}) = f(\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{F}) + \mathbf{F}\cdot(\mathbf{\nabla}f)$$

integrating both sides over a volume $\mathcal{V}$

$$\int_{\mathcal{V}}\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot (f\thinspace\mathbf{F})\thinspace d^3x = \int_{\mathcal{V}}\Big(f\thinspace(\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{F}) + \mathbf{F}\cdot(\mathbf{\nabla}f)\Big)\thinspace d^3x$$

and re-writing the LHS using the divergence theorem

$$\oint_{\mathcal{S}}\mathbf{U}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}\thinspace da=\int_{\mathcal{V}}\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{U}\thinspace d^3x$$

with $\mathbf{U}=f\thinspace\mathbf{F}$ gives

$$\oint_{\mathcal{S}} f\thinspace\mathbf{F}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}\thinspace da=\int_{\mathcal{V}} \Big(f\thinspace(\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{F}) +\mathbf{F}\cdot(\mathbf{\nabla}f)\Big)\thinspace d^3x$$

Using $f = \phi$, $\mathbf{F}=\nabla\psi$, and $\nabla\psi\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}=\partial \psi/\partial n$ in the above gives

$$\oint_\mathcal{S}\phi\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial n} da=\int_\mathcal{V}\Big(\phi\nabla^2\psi + \nabla\psi\boldsymbol{\cdot}\nabla\phi\Big)d^3x$$

Using the fact that the dot product commutes and swapping the LHS and RHS gives

$$\int_\mathcal{V} \left(\phi\nabla^2\psi + \nabla\phi\boldsymbol{\cdot}\nabla\psi\right)d^3x=\oint_\mathcal{S}\phi\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial n} da$$

* This should work for any functions for which the divergence theorem applies.
* Surface needs to be closed. This is implied by the notation, but the notation is required because the divergence theorem was used.
* Volume can have a cavity. The divergence theorem still applies. Given a cavity, there will be two surfaces, and outer and inner. The normal direction points outward for the surfaces, so a sphere with a cavity centered on the origin will have an outside surface normal in the $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ direction and an inside surface normal in the $-\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ direction.

$\phi(\mathbf{x})$ is a scalar function that is created by a continuous scalar volume charge density $\rho(\mathbf{x})$ implies that it satisfies Poisson's equation $\nabla^2\phi=-\rho/\epsilon_0$.

With a change to a primed integration variable, we need to replace $\nabla$ with $\nabla'$ and swap $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{x}'$ in the integrand. Then we can use

$$\nabla'^2 \left(\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}'-\mathbf{x}|}\right) = -4\pi\delta(\mathbf{x}'-\mathbf{x}) = -4\pi\delta(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}')$$

and

$$\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}'-\mathbf{x}|}=\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}$$

Yes. I raised this question because it is something that you should notice - in various place in Jackson, he'll explicitly give the dependence of some function and not other.

If the geometry is a point charge at $\mathbf{x}'=0$, then on a sphere centered on the origin it is proportional to $E_r$, the electric field in the radial direction (In this case $n'=r'$).

$$\phi(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\int_\mathcal{V}\frac{\rho(\mathbf{x'})}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'}|}d^3x'-\frac{1}{4\pi}\oint_\mathcal{S}\left(\phi\frac{\partial}{\partial n'}\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'}|}-\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'}|}\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial n'}\right) da'$$

By the property of the delta function that $\delta(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}')=0$ when $\mathbf{x} \ne \mathbf{x}'$

$$\int_\mathcal{V} -4\pi\phi(\mathbf{x'})\delta(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'})\thinspace d^3x'=0$$

if $\mathbf{x}$ is outside the volume $\mathcal{V}$ because $\delta(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'})$ will always be zero.

So that constraint is that $\mathbf{x}$ is in $\mathcal{V}$.

7. Explain the conditions under which this equation reduces to

This will be true if the charges in the system and a surface can be selected so the RHS is zero or if the surface is chosen to be so far away from any charges so that the integral approaches zero. Jackson notes on pg. 37 that the electric field must fall of faster than $|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|^{-1}$. This claim is justified in the solution to the first problem in this HW.

Can you think of a distribution of charges and a surface that is not at infinity so that the RHS is zero?

1.## Green Functions 

Green's theorem (second identity) derived earlier is

$$\int_{\mathcal{V}} \left(\phi\nabla^2\psi -\psi\nabla^2\phi\right)d^3x=\oint_{\mathcal{S}}\left(\phi\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial n}-\psi\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n}\right) da$$

Assume that $\phi$ is an electric potential associated in a volume $\mathcal{V}$ with a continuous scalar volume charge density $\rho$ in $\mathcal{V}$ and charges on the surface of $S$ of $\mathcal{V}$ held at a known potential, Now, instead of using

$$\psi(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}$$

use

$$\psi(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}+F(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')$$

9. What is the constraint on $F$ so that one can write

$$\int_{\mathcal{V}} \left(-4\pi\phi(\mathbf{x'})\delta(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}')+\psi(\mathbf{x}')\rho(\mathbf{x'})/\epsilon_o\right)d^3x'=\oint_{\mathcal{S}}\left(\phi\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial n'}-\psi\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n'}\right) da'$$

$$\nabla^2F(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')=0$$

Writing the LHS integral with primed integration variables and explicitly writing out the functional dependence gives

$$I = \int_{\mathcal{V}} \left[\phi(\mathbf{x'})\nabla'^2\psi(\mathbf{x'}) -\psi(\mathbf{x'})\nabla'^2\phi(\mathbf{x'})\right]d^3x'$$

In primed coordinates

$$\psi(\mathbf{x}')=\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}'-\mathbf{x}|}+F(\mathbf{x}',\mathbf{x})$$

We need to evaluate $\nabla'^2\psi(\mathbf{x'})$ in the integral, which gives

$$\nabla'^2\psi(\mathbf{x'})=\nabla'^2\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}'-\mathbf{x}|}+\nabla'^2F(\mathbf{x'},\mathbf{x})=-4\pi\delta(\mathbf{x}'-\mathbf{x})+\nabla'^2F(\mathbf{x}',\mathbf{x})$$

With $\nabla'^2\phi(\mathbf{x'})=-\rho(\mathbf{x'})/\epsilon_o$ and $\nabla'^2F(\mathbf{x}',\mathbf{x})=0$, we can write

$$I = \int_{\mathcal{V}} \left[\phi(\mathbf{x'})\nabla'^2\psi(\mathbf{x'}) -\psi(\mathbf{x'})\nabla'^2\phi(\mathbf{x'})\right]d^3x$$

as

$$I=\int_{\mathcal{V}} \left[-4\pi\phi(\mathbf{x'})\delta(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'})+\psi(\mathbf{x}')\rho(\mathbf{x'})/\epsilon_o\right]d^3x'$$

10. What is an additional constraint on $F$ so that one can write

$$\int_{\mathcal{V}}\left[-4\pi\phi(\mathbf{x'})\delta(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'})+\psi(\mathbf{x}')\rho(\mathbf{x'})/\epsilon_o\right]d^3x'=\oint_{\mathcal{S}}\phi\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial n'} da'$$

$$F(\mathbf{x}',\mathbf{x})=-\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}'-\mathbf{x}|}\quad\mbox{for}\thinspace\mathbf{x}'\mbox{on}\thinspaceS$$

This corresponds to $\psi(\mathbf{x}')=0$ on $S$.

The integral

$$\oint_{\mathcal{S}}\psi\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n'}da'$$

must be zero. One way for this to be true is for $\psi(\mathbf{x}')$ to be zero on $S$, 

$$\psi(\mathbf{x}')=0=\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}'-\mathbf{x}|}+F(\mathbf{x}',\mathbf{x})$$

so that

$$F(\mathbf{x}',\mathbf{x})=-\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}'-\mathbf{x}|}$$

on $S$. Note that this gives $\psi(\mathbf{x}')=0$ on $S$, but inside of $\mathcal{V}$, $\psi(\mathbf{x}')$ is in general zero.

Evaluation of the first term in the volume integral and rearrangement gives

$$\phi(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\int_{\mathcal{V}}\psi(\mathbf{x}')\rho(\mathbf{x'}) d^3x'-\frac{1}{4\pi}\oint_{\mathcal{S}}\phi\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial n'} da'$$

11. Explain how this equation justifies the statement that if one knows how charge is distributed inside of a volume and something about the potential $\phi$ on the surface of the volume, one can compute the potential everywhere inside of the volume.

This equation was derived under the assumption that $\mathbf{x}$ was inside $V$. The first term involves charges inside the volume; the second term involves the potential on the surface of the volume. According to this equation, we don't need information about the charges outside the volume to compute the potential inside of the volume! (Provided that we know ${\partial \psi}/{\partial n}$ on the surface.)

Note that there is an additional constraint. We need to have a function $F$ with the two properties identified above.

In summary, one can compute the potential inside of a volume $V$ given
1. ${\partial \psi}/{\partial n}$ on the surface of the volume;
1. $\rho$ inside the volume;
1. a function $F$ that has the property $\nabla^2F(\mathbf{x})=0$ and $F(\mathbf{x})=-\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}$ for $\mathbf{x}$ on $\mathcal{S}$.

Finding the function $F$ is not trivial. It happens that one method of finding this function, which allows us to solve many electrostatic problems, is to solve a specific electrostatic problem involving a point charge and a grounded conductor. If we can solve that specific problem, we can then solve many any problem where we are given ${\partial \psi}/{\partial n}$ on the surface of a volume and $\rho$ inside the volume.

Keep in mind that "solve" in the previous paragraph means that we can find the potential using integration. In many cases the integrals do not have a known analytic solution and must be solved numerically.

Consider flat and infinite plane.  

12. What is $F$ and $\mathbf{x}'$ in the equation

$$\psi(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}+F(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')$$

that gives $\psi(\mathbf{x})=0$ on the surface of the plane and $\nabla^2F=0$ above the plane? Recall that you found a function that had this property in a previous homework problem in which you computed the potential when a point charge was placed at a distance $d$ above an infinite, flat, and grounded plane. For generality, assume the point charge is at $\mathbf{x}'=x'\hat{\mathbf{x}}+y'\hat{\mathbf{y}}+z'\hat{\mathbf{z}}$ instead of $z_o\hat{\mathbf{z}}$.

$$F(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}') = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(x-x')^2 + (y-y')^2 + (z+z')^2}}$$

$$\nabla^2F = -4\pi\delta(x-x')\delta(y-y')\delta(z+z')=0\quad\text{for}\thinspacez\gt 0$$
|}

This function $\psi(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')$ that has above-identified properties is called a Green function for an infinite plane geometry and is re-named to as $G(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')$ in what follows. This function was derived with the aid of the solution to the problem of a point charge above an infinite and grounded conducting plane. The power of knowing the Green function is that it can be used to solve for the potential in a different problem - a problem where the potential is known on an infinite plane and the charge density above the plane is zero.

Because the charge density in the different problem is zero, the first integral is zero in

$$\phi(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\int_{\mathcal{V}}G(\mathbf{x}',\mathbf{x})\rho(\mathbf{x'}) d^3x'-\frac{1}{4\pi}\oint_{\mathcal{S}}\phi\frac{\partial G(\mathbf{x}',\mathbf{x})}{\partial n'} da'$$

and one only needs to be given the potential on the plane, $\phi(x,y,z=0)$, and to evaluate the integral

$$\phi(\mathbf{x})=-\frac{1}{4\pi}\oint_{\mathcal{S}}\phi\frac{\partial G(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')}{\partial n'} da'$$

to find the potential above the plane.

Note that $n=-z$ because the volume is the half-space for which $z\gt 0$ and the normal direction always points outwards from the volume.

Using for $G(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')$ the function $\psi(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')$ found previously when $F$ was found, 

13. compute $\frac{\partial G(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')}{\partial n'}$ at $z'=0$ and show that given $\phi(x,y,z=0)$, one can write

$$\phi(x,y,z)=\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\phi(x',y',z'=0)\frac{2z}{\left((x-x')^2+(y-y')^2+z^2\right)^{3/2}} dx'dy'$$

The derivative calculation is straight-forward and was done in a previous problem. Starting with

$$\phi(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\int_{\mathcal{V}}G(\mathbf{x}',\mathbf{x})\rho(\mathbf{x'}) d^3x'-\frac{1}{4\pi}\oint_{\mathcal{S}}\phi\frac{\partial G(\mathbf{x}',\mathbf{x})}{\partial n'} da'$$

The first term on the right-hand side is zero assuming that there are no other charges in the system - we are only given a plane with the potential specified on the surface.

We are given $\phi$ in the $z=0$ plane - and this plane does not form a closed surface. To close the surface, consider the system to be a hemisphere with the flat part in the $z=0$ plane. The integral given above is over the flat part of the hemisphere. To write the above equation, one must assume the potential on the hemisphere is zero (this is not often explicitly stated when this problem is given). This is consistent with $G$, which has the property of being zero for large $r$.

14. Show that if the potential is in the plane is given by $\phi(x,y,z=0)=V_o$ for $x^2+y^2\le a^2$ and  $\phi(x,y,z=0)=0$ otherwise, then the potential along the $z-$axis is

$$\phi(z)=V_o\left(1-\frac{z}{\sqrt{z^2+a^2}}\right)$$

Set $x=y=0$ and use polar coordinates with a radial coordinate $s'=\sqrt{x'^2+y'^2}$.

$$\phi(z)=\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{a}Vo\frac{2z}{\left(s'^2+z^2\right)^{3/2}} s'ds'd\phi'$$
$$\phi(z)=V_oz\int_{0}^{a}\frac{s'ds'}{\left(s'^2+z^2\right)^{3/2}} s'ds'=-\frac{V_oz}{\sqrt{s'^2+z^2}}\Bigg|_{s'=0}^{a}$$
$$\phi(z)=V_o\left(\frac{z}{|z|}-\frac{z}{\sqrt{z^2+a^2}}\right)$$

For $z\gt 0$, $z/|z|=1$, which gives

$$\phi(z)=V_o\left(1-\frac{z}{\sqrt{z^2+a^2}}\right)$$

15. Show that for the same boundary potential  $\phi(x,y,z=0)$ and for $r^2\equiv x^2+y^2+z^2\gg a^2$, the off-axis potential can be approximated as

$$\phi(x,y,z)\approx\frac{V_oa^2}{2}\frac{z}{r^3}\left(1-\frac{3a^2}{4r^2}\right)$$

To show this, re-write

$$\frac{1}{\left((x-x')^2+(y-y')^2+z^2\right)^{3/2}}$$

as 

$$\frac{1}{\left(r^2+s'^2-2xx'-2yy'\right)^{3/2}}$$

factor out $r$

$$\frac{1}{r^3}\frac{1}{\left(1+(s'/r)^2-2(x/r)(x'/r)-2(y/r)(y'/r)\right)^{3/2}}$$

For the integration, $s'$, $x'$, and $y'$ are $\le a$ so $s'/r\ll 1$ as is $x'/r$ and $y'/r$. The terms $y/r$ and $x/r$ can vary from $-1$ to $1$. Defining

$$\delta = (s'/r)^2-2(x/r)(x'/r)-2(y/r)(y'/r)$$

gives

$$\frac{1}{r^3}\frac{1}{\left(1+\delta\right)^{3/2}}$$

$\delta \ll 1$ as argued above. The binomial expansion (or Taylor series expansion) gives

$$\frac{1}{r^3}\frac{1}{\left(1+\delta\right)^{3/2}}\simeq \frac{1}{r^3}\left(1-\frac{3}{2}\delta\right)+...$$

Using this, the integral equation

$$\phi(x,y,z)=\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{a}V_o\frac{2z}{\left((x-x')^2+(y-y')^2+z^2\right)^{3/2}} s'ds'd\phi'$$

becomes

$$\phi(x,y,z)\simeq\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{a}V_o\frac{2z}{r^3} \left(1-\frac{3}{2}\delta\right) s'ds'd\phi'$$

or

$$\phi(x,y,z)\simeq \frac{V_o}{2}\frac{z}{r^3}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{a}\left(1-\frac{3}{2}\delta\right) s'ds'$$

$$\delta = (s'/r)^2-2(x/r)(x'/r)-2(y/r)(y'/r)$$

After integrating over $\phi'$, only the first term remains because $x'=s'\cos\phi$ and $y'=s'\cos\phi$.

$$\phi(x,y,z)\simeq V_o\frac{z}{r^3}\int_{0}^{a}\left(1-\frac{3}{2}\frac{s'^2}{r^2}\right) s'ds'$$

integration gives

$$\phi(x,y,z)\approx\frac{V_oa^2}{2}\frac{z}{r^3}\left(1-\frac{3a^2}{4r^2}\right)$$

|}

For the $z$-axis solution of

$$\phi(z)=V_o\left(1-\frac{z}{\sqrt{z^2+a^2}}\right)$$

suppose a point charge is placed at $z=d$. It may seem that by superposition, the potential on the $z$-axis would be

$$\phi(z)=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\frac{1}{|z-d|}+V_o\left(1+\frac{z}{\sqrt{z^2+a^2}}\right)$$

However, the correct additional term is not $\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\frac{1}{|z-d|}$ but is rather that obtained from evaluating

$$\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\int_{\mathcal{V}}\psi(\mathbf{x}')\rho(\mathbf{x'}) d^3x'$$

with $\rho(\mathbf{x'})=q\delta(x)\delta(y)\delta(z-d)$, and $\psi=G$. Evaluation gives

$$\frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\frac{1}{|z-d|}-\frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\frac{1}{|z+d|}$$

16. Explain this.

With the addition of the point charge, charges will appear on the conducting plane. The simple addition of the potential due only the point charges does not account for the charges that are induced on the conducting plane. Adding

$$\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\frac{1}{|z-d|}-\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\frac{1}{|z+d|}$$

is equivalent to the superposition of the potential created by the disk at potential $a$ and the potential due to a point charge above an infinite plane.

# HW 5 

Due Wednesday, March 5th.

## 1-D Green Function 

Equation 1.44 of Jackson states that the potential within a volume $\mathcal{V}$ enclosed by surface $\mathcal{S}$ can be computed using

$$\Psi(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\int_{\mathcal{V}}G_D(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')\rho(\mathbf{x'}) d^3x'-\frac{1}{4\pi}\oint_{\mathcal{S}}\Psi(\mathbf{x}')\frac{\partial G_D}{\partial n'} da'$$

provided that a Green function $G_D$ is known that satisfies

$$\nabla'^2G_D=-4\pi\delta(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}')\qquad\text{for}\thinspace\mathbf{x}'\thinspace\thinspace\text{in}\thinspace\thinspace\mathcal{V}$$

and

$$G_D(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}') = 0\qquad\text{for}\thinspace\mathbf{x}'\thinspace\thinspace\text{on}\thinspace\thinspace\mathcal{S}$$

Previously, Green functions were found using the method of images. In this problem, you will find the Green function using an alternative method.

Consider two infinite, parallel, and grounded conducting sheets in the $x=0$ and $x=d$ plane. In the $x=x'$ plane, there is an infinite non-conducting sheet with surface charge density $\sigma'$.

1. Find the potentials to the left, $\psi_l$, and right, $\psi_r$, of the non-conducting sheet using any method.

2. Write the potential $\psi(x)$ for $0\le x\le d$ as a single function using $\psi_l$ and $\psi_r$ and the Heavyside step function $\Theta$.

3. Show that $\psi(0)=0$, $\psi(d)=0$, and $\nabla'^2\psi \sim \delta(x-x')$ and so this $\psi$ is proportional to $G_D$, and find the proportionality constant.

Now that $G_D$ is known, the potential between the two conducting planes given any charge distribution $\rho$ can be computed using

$$\Psi(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\int_{\mathcal{V}}G_D(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')\rho(\mathbf{x'}) d^3x'-\frac{1}{4\pi}\oint_{\mathcal{S}}\Psi(\mathbf{x}')\frac{\partial G_D}{\partial n'} da'$$

Conceptually, one can see that the first integral is a weighted sum of $G_D$, which is proportional to the potential for a single sheet of charge between the plates at $x'$. This integral sums the potentials for a continuous set of sheets.

4. Suppose the conducting planes are grounded and a non-conducting slab with charge density $\rho_o$ exists between them. Use the above equation to find $\Psi(\mathbf{x})$ between the conducting planes. 

Notes: You will need to use the fact that $\Theta$ modifies the limits of integration, $d\Theta(x)/dx=\delta(x)$, and $d\Theta(-x)/dx=-\delta(x)$. You can check your answer either using Gauss' law or the boundary value method to find $\Psi(x)$.

Let subscript $l$ refer to quantities for $x\lt x'$ and subscript $r$ refer to quantities for $x\gt x'$.

1.

One can answer this question by assuming a surface charge of $\sigma_l$ and $\sigma_r$ is induced on the plates at $x=0$ and $x=w$. Then use the formula $\sigma/2\epsilon_o$ for the electric field of the sheets of charge at $x=0$, $x=x'$, and $x=w$ to get the total field $E_l$ and $E_r$.  The two unknowns, $\sigma_l$ and $\sigma_r$, can be found by using the fact that the electric field in either of the conductors is zero - this yields $\sigma' = -(\sigma_l+\sigma_r)$, which is expected because the net charge in the universe is zero. The second equation needed to find $\sigma_l$ and $\sigma_r$ in terms of $\sigma'$ is

$$\psi(w)-\psi(0) = 0 = -\int_0^w E\thinspace dx=-\int_0^{x'}E_ldx-\int_{x'}^wE_rdx$$

Some students wrote their final answers in terms of $\sigma_l$ and $\sigma_r$. These were not parameters given in the problem statement and so such a solution is incomplete.

Alternatively, one can use the fact that $\nabla^2 \psi(x)=0$ has solutions of the form $\psi=a+bx$, the two boundary conditions and the continuity and jump conditions at $x=x'$.

$$\psi_l=A_l+B_lx$$

$$\psi_r=A_r+B_rx$$

Boundary conditions:

$$\psi_l(0)=0\Rightarrow A_l=0$$

$$\psi_r(w)=0=A_r+B_rw\Rightarrow A_r=-B_rw$$

This leaves

$$\psi_l=B_lx$$

$$\psi_r=B_r(x-w)$$

Continuity:

$$\psi_l(x')=\psi_r(x')\Rightarrow B_lx'=B_r(x'-w)$$

Jump:

$$\left[-\frac{\partial \psi_r}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial \psi_l}{\partial x}\right]_{x=x'}=\frac{\sigma'}{\epsilon_o}$$

$$-B_r+B_l=\frac{\sigma'}{\epsilon_o}\Rightarrow B_l=B_r+\frac{\sigma'}{\epsilon_o}$$

The three equations left are

$$A_r=-B_rw$$

$$B_lx'=B_r(x'-w)$$

$$B_l=B_r+\frac{\sigma'}{\epsilon_o}$$

Solving gives

$$B_l=-\frac{\sigma'}{\epsilon_o}\left(\frac{x'}{w}-1\right)$$

$$B_r=-\frac{\sigma'}{\epsilon_o}\frac{x'}{w}$$

So the final solution is

$$\psi_l=\frac{\sigma'}{\epsilon_o}\left(1-\frac{x'}{w}\right)x$$

$$\psi_r=\frac{\sigma'}{\epsilon_o}\left(1-\frac{x}{w}\right)x'$$

Note that swapping $x$ and $x'$ in $\psi_l$ gives the equation for $\psi_r$, and vice-versa. That is, $\psi_l(x',x)=\psi_r(x,x')$.

2.

$$\psi=\psi_l(x)\Theta(x'-x)+\psi_r(x)\Theta(x-x')$$

Checks: 
* When $x\lt x'$, $\Theta(x'-x)=1$ and $\Theta(x-x')=0$, giving $\psi=\psi_l$.
* When $x\gt x'$, $\Theta(x'-x)=0$ and $\Theta(x-x')=1$, giving $\psi=\psi_lr$.

3.

$$\frac{d\psi}{dx} = \psi_l(x)\frac{d}{dx}\Theta(x'-x) + \Theta(x'-x)\frac{d\psi_l(x)}{dx} + \psi_r(x)\frac{d}{dx}\Theta(x-x')+\Theta(x-x')\frac{d\psi_r(x)}{dx}$$

If one plots $\psi(x)$, you will see that its derivative has a jump downwards at $x=x'$ of $\sigma'/\epsilon_o$ and so we expect the terms in $d\psi/dx$ with the derivative of the Heavyside step function, which is the delta function, to be zero. So the two terms involving derivatives of $\Theta$ will be addressed first.

The first term can be rewritten using

$$\frac{d}{dx}\Theta(x'-x)=-\delta(x'-x)=-\delta(x-x')$$

The first equality follows from the identity given in the problem statement: $d\Theta(-x)/dx=-\delta(x)$. The second equality is a standard delta function identity.

The second term is

$$\frac{d}{dx}\Theta(x-x')=\delta(x-x')$$

The following two equalities follow from the fact that $\delta(x-x')$ is zero except at $x=x'$:

$$-\psi_l(x)\delta(x-x')=-\psi_l(x')\delta(x-x')$$

$$\psi_r(x)\delta(x-x')=\psi_r(x')\delta(x-x')$$

As a result of these considerations, the two terms in $d\psi/dx$ involving derivatives of $\Theta$ cancel, leaving

$$\frac{d\psi}{dx} = \Theta(x'-x)\frac{d\psi_l(x)}{dx} +\Theta(x-x')\frac{d\psi_r(x)}{dx}$$

Straightforward calculation and use of the same identities as above gives

$$\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2}=-\frac{\sigma'}{\epsilon_o}\delta(x-x')$$

This matches expectations. For a sheet of charge in the $x=x'$ plane, the volume charge density is

$$\rho=\sigma'\delta(x-x')$$

and Poisson's equation is

$$\nabla^2\psi=-\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_o}$$

(Recall that the units of $\delta(x)$ are inverse length. This follows from part of the definition of the delta function: $\int\delta(x)dx=1$).

We need $G_D$ such that

$$\nabla'^2G_D=-4\pi\delta(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}')\qquad\text{for}\thinspace\mathbf{x}'\thinspace\thinspace\text{in}\thinspace\thinspace\mathcal{V}$$

The units of $\delta(\mathbf{x})$ are 1/length$^3$. This follows from part of the definition of the 3-D delta function: $\int\delta(\mathbf{x})dx=1$. It is somewhat unconventional for a function with a scalar argument to have different units than when it has a vector argument and so some authors use $^3\delta(\mathbf{x})$ instead of $\delta(\mathbf{x})$. 

In one dimension, $\delta(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}')=\delta(x-x')/A$, so

$$\nabla'^2G_D=-4\pi\delta(x-x')/A$$

where $A$ is the area of the sheets. 

The $A$ here plays a role similar to the $4\pi b^2$ found in the example done in class for the Green function associated with the interior of a sphere of radius $b$. 

Due to the property $G_D(x,x')=G_D(x',x)$, we can equivalently write 

$$\nabla^2G_D=-4\pi\delta(x-x')$$

Several students thought that $\nabla'^2G_D$ in the problem statement was a typo and that it should have been $\nabla^2G_D$. Because $G_D(x,x')=G_D(x,x')$, either can be used. I used the primed version to be consistent with the derivation of equation 1.42 of Jackson, which uses the primed version in equation 1.39.

----

If you are uncomfortable with the appearance of $A$ here, go back to the derivation of equation 1.42 of Jackson, but repeat assuming $\psi$ and $\phi$ in equation 1.35 only on $x$. Another way of concluding (\nabla'^2G_D=-4\pi\delta(x-x')/A$ is to integrate $\nabla'^2G_D(x,x')=-4\pi\delta(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}')=-4\pi\delta(x-x')\delta(y-y')\delta(z-z')$ over the non-varying dimensions :

$$\int\int dy'dz'\nabla'^2G_D(x,x')=-4\pi\int \int dy'dz'\delta(x-x')\delta(y-y')\delta(z-z')=-4\pi\delta(x-x')$$

$$AG_D(x,x')=-4\pi\delta(x-x')$$

----

Comparison of 

$$\nabla'^2G_D=-4\pi\delta(x-x')/A$$

with 

$$\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2}=-\frac{\sigma'}{\epsilon_o}\delta(x-x')$$

gives

$$G_D(x,x') = \frac{4\pi\epsilon_o}{A\sigma'}\psi$$

4.

Now that we have $G_D$ for this geometry, we can use it for any $\rho$ and any boundary condition. Take the volume $\mathcal{V}$ to have a volume of $Aw$. Its surface has 6 faces. Four of the faces have normal directions that are perpendicular to the $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ direction and so $\partial G_D/\partial n'=0$ on these faces (e.g.,  $\partial G_D/\partial y'=\partial G_D/\partial z'=0$). 

In the new problem, we are given that $\psi=0$ at $x=0$ and $x=d$ and so $\psi=0$ on the two faces with a normals in the $\pm x$ direction. As a result, the surface integral term in

$$\Psi(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\int_{\mathcal{V}}G_D(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')\rho(\mathbf{x'}) d^3x'-\frac{1}{4\pi}\oint_{\mathcal{S}}\Psi(\mathbf{x}')\frac{\partial G_D}{\partial n'} da'$$

is zero. This leaves

$$\Psi(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\int_{\mathcal{V}}G_D(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')\rho(\mathbf{x'}) d^3x'$$

{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"

It is at this point that we can recognize that because $G_D$ is proportional to $\psi$, this integral represents the summation of the potentials due to sheets of charge that are continuously distributed between $0$ and $w$ such that they form a continuous charge density $\rho$. In fact, without knowledge of Green's functions, one may have concluded that to find the potential due to a continuous $\rho$, one only needed to do a weighted sum of potentials due a single sheet of charge at $x'$. That is, you could use the replacement $\sigma'=\rho(x\thinspace dx'$ and then $\Psi(x)=\int_0^w (\psi(x')/\sigma')\rho(x\thinspace dx'$.
|}

One can also check this equation by using $\rho=\sigma'\delta(x-x')$ and $G_D$ found above and verifying that the resulting $\Psi$ matches the potential $\psi$ used to form $G_D$.

Rewriting the Green function

$$G_D(x,x') = \frac{4\pi\epsilon_o}{A\sigma'}\psi$$

Using

$$\psi=\psi_l(x)\Theta(x'-x)+\psi_r(x)\Theta(x-x')$$

and

$$\psi_l=\frac{\sigma'}{\epsilon_o}\left(1-\frac{x'}{w}\right)x$$

$$\psi_r=\frac{\sigma'}{\epsilon_o}\left(1-\frac{x}{w}\right)x'$$

gives

$$G_D(x,x') = \frac{4\pi}{Aw}\left[(w-x')x\Theta(x'-x)+(w-x)x'\Theta(x-x')\right]$$

Using $\rho=\rho_o$ and $G_D$ in

$$\Psi(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\int_{\mathcal{V}}G_D(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')\rho(\mathbf{x'}) d^3x'$$

gives

$$\Psi(x)=\frac{\rho_o}{w\epsilon_o}\int_0^w \left[(w-x')x\Theta(x'-x)+(w-x)x'\Theta(x-x')\righ\thinspace dx'$$

The $\Theta$ function modifies the limits of integration

$$\Psi(x)=\frac{\rho_o}{w\epsilon_o} \left[\int_x^w(w-x'\thinspace dx' +\int_0^x(w-x)\thinspace dx'\right]$$

and integration gives

$$\Psi(x) = \frac{\rho_ow^2}{2\epsilon_o}\left[\frac{x}{w}-\frac{x^2}{w^2}\right]$$

As a final check, note that $\Psi(0)=\Psi(w)=0$ and $d^2\Psi/x^2=-\rho_o/\epsilon_o$.

(For practice with the $\Theta$ function, try this problem using $\rho=\rho_o\Theta(x-w/2)$ so that only half of the space is filled with a charged slab. In this case, there will be two $\Psi(x)$ functions, one for $x\lt w/2$ and the other for $x\gt w/2$. One student noted that the problem statement did not say that $\rho_o$ filled the space and tried to solve this assuming a conducting slab with an arbitrary thickness - however, the slab thickness was not given as a parameter in the problem statement so it is safe to assume that $\rho_o$ fills the space.)

An alternative way of computing $\Psi$ is to start with

$$\frac{d^2\Psi}{dx^2} = -\frac{\rho_o}{\epsilon_o}$$

Direct integration gives

$$\Psi(x) = -\frac{\rho_o}{\epsilon_o}\frac{x^2}{2} + C_1x + C_0$$

Using $\Psi(0)=\Psi(w)=0$ to find $C_0$ and $C_1$ gives

$$\Psi(x) = \frac{\rho_ow^2}{2\epsilon_o}\left[\frac{x}{w}-\frac{x^2}{w^2}\right]$$

Alternatively, one can solve this problem using Gauss' law to find the electric field (it is easiest to use a Gaussian cylinder centered on $x=w/2$ with a height of $w-2x$).

## Monopole Expansion Using "Standard" Method 

1. Write down the potential $\psi$ as a function of $(x,y,z)$ for a point charge $q$ located at $(x,y,z)=(0,0,z')$ using $kq=1$.

2. Write out the first three terms in the Taylor series expansion of $\psi$ for $z'/r \ll 1$.

3. Show that your result is consistent with equation 3.38 of Jackson 3rd edition:

$$\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|} = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{r^l_{<}}{r^{l+1}_{>}}P_l(\cos \gamma)$$

where $r_{<}$ ( $r_{<}$) is the smaller (larger) of $|\mathbf{x}|$ and $|\mathbf{x}'|$ and $\gamma$ is the angle between $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{x}'$.

4. Show how your result consistent with equation 3.95 of Griffiths 4th edition (by using the delta function to represent the charge density):

$$\psi(\mathbf{r})=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{r^{n+1}}\int(r')^nP_n(\cos\alpha)\rho(\mathbf{r}')d\tau'$$

which was derived assuming that the maximum value of $r'$ for which $\rho\ne 0$ is much less than $r$ and $\alpha$ is the angle between $\mathbf{r}$ and $\mathbf{r}'$.

'''Optional Problem'''

Repeat the above for a point charge located at $(x,y,z)=(0,y',0)$.

1.

$$\psi = \frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|} =\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+(z-z')^2}}$$

2.

For the case $r\gg z'$, factor out $r$ and re-write in a form that is straightforward to expand as a Taylor series

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|} &=\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+(z-z')^2}}\\
&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2+z'^2-2zz'}}&&\text{Expand }(z-z')^2\\
&=\frac{1}{|r|\sqrt{1+z'^2/r^2-2zz'/r^2}}&&\text{Using}\thinspacer^2=x^2+y^2+z^2\thinspace\text{and factoring out}\thinspacer\\
&=\frac{1}{r\sqrt{1+z'^2/r^2-2(z'/r)\cos\theta}}&&\text{Using}\thinspacez=r\cos\theta\text{ and }|r|=r\\
& =\frac{1}{r\sqrt{1+\delta}}&&\text{Defining }\delta\equiv z'^2/r^2-2(z'/r)\cos\theta
\end{align}
$$

For $\delta<1$, the binomial function $(1+\delta)^{-1/2}$ can be expanded as a Taylor series, the result of which is

$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\delta}}=1-\frac{1}{2}\delta+\frac{3}{8}\delta^2-\frac{5}{16}\delta^3+...$$

Evaluating terms of order $\delta^2$ and lower using $\delta = z'^2/r^2-2(z'/r)\cos\theta$ gives

$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\delta}}=1-\frac{1}{2}\left(z'^2/r^2-2(z'/r)\cos\theta\right)+\frac{3}{8}\left(z'^2/r^2-2(z'/r)\cos\theta\right)^2+...$$

This can be written in terms of a power series ordered by powers of $z'/r$ giving the result

$$\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}=\frac{1}{r}\left(1+\frac{z'}{r}\cos\theta+\left(\frac{z'}{r}\right)^2\frac{1}{2}\left(3\cos^2\theta-1\right)-\left(\frac{z'}{r}\right)^3\frac{3}{2}\cos\theta+\frac{3}{8}\left(\frac{z'}{r}\right)^4...\right)$$

The first three terms are identified as $P_0,P_1,$, and $P_2$. The last two terms are parts of $P_4$ and $P_5$ - the full $P_4$ and $P_5$ appear if the $\delta^3$ term is expanded.  Therefore the two expressions are consistent up to $l=2$.

3.

The above equation is to be compared with

$$\sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{r^l_{<}}{r^{l+1}_{>}}P_l(\cos \gamma)=\frac{1}{r_{>}}\sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{r^l_{<}}{r^l_{>}}P_l(\cos \gamma)$$

which, given the problem statement and the assumption that $z' < r$, we identify $r_{>}$ as $r$, $r_{<}$ as $z'$. The angle $\gamma$ between $r$ and $r'$ is the same as the spherical polar angle $\theta$ when $r'$ is aligned with the $z$-axis. With this,

$$\frac{1}{r_{>}}\sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{r^l_{<}}{r^l_{>}}P_l(\cos \gamma)=\frac{1}{r}\sum_{l=0}^\infty \left(\frac{z'}{r}\right)^l P_l(\cos \theta)$$

Therefore the two expressions are consistent up to $l=2$.

The steps above can be repeated by factoring out $z'$ and using $\delta \equiv r^2/z'^2-2(r/z')\cos\theta$ for the case $z'\gg r$.

4.

Note that there is a complication introduced by choosing the location of the charge to be $z'$ when using Griffiths equation 3.95. (If I had stated that the charge was located at $z_o$ instead of $z'$, we would not have this problem.) In the integral

$$\int(r')^nP_n(\cos\alpha)\rho(\mathbf{r}')d\tau'$$

the dummy index is also primed. In this problem, the location of the charge is $\mathbf{r}'=(0,0,z')$, so the charge density can be written as

$$\rho(\mathbf{r})=q\delta(x)\delta(y)\delta(z-z')$$

Plugging this into the expression for the delta function would give

$$\rho({\mathbf{r}'})=q\delta(x')\delta(y')\delta(z'-z')=q\delta(x')\delta(y')\delta(0)$$

This does not make sense because the charge density should be zero everywhere except for at the point $(0,0,z')$.

To circumvent this issue, choose the dummy integration index to be double primed (or use $z_o$ as the location of the charge instead of $z'$). If the dummy index is double-primed, then

<nowiki>
$$\rho({\mathbf{r}^{\prime\prime}})=q\delta(x^{\prime\prime})\delta(y^{\prime\prime})\delta(z^{\prime\prime}-z')$$

which corresponds to the charge density of a point charge at a fixed location $z'$. Then

$$\rho({\mathbf{r}''})=q\delta(x'')\delta(y'')\delta(z''-z')$$

which corresponds to the charge density of a point charge at a fixed location $z'$. Then

$$\psi(\mathbf{r})=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{r^{n+1}}\int(r'')^nP_n(\cos\alpha)\rho(\mathbf{r}'')d\tau''$$

Using $\alpha=\theta$ and factoring out (\q$ and $P_l(\cos(\theta))$ and using $kq=1$ gives

$$\psi(\mathbf{r})=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{r^{n+1}}P_n(\cos\theta)\int\int\int(x''^2+y''^2+z''^2)^{n/2}\rho(\mathbf{r}'')dx''dy''dz''$$

The integral evaluates to

$$
\begin{align}
& \int\int\int(x'^2+y'^2+z'^2)^{n/2} q\delta(x'')\delta(y'')\delta(z''-z') dx''dy''dz''=\\
& \int\int(y''^2+z''^2)^{n/2} q\delta(y'')\delta(z''-z') dy'dz' = \\
& \int(z''^2)^n q\delta(z''-z') dz''=\\
& z'^{n}
\end{align}
$$
</nowiki>

The final result is

$$\psi = \frac{1}{r}\sum_{l=0}^\infty \left(\frac{z'}{r}\right)^l P_l(\cos \theta)$$

which is the same as found earlier.

'''Optional'''

For the case the charge at $(0,y',0)$, one needs to note that $y=r\sin\theta\sin\phi=r\cos\gamma$ and follow the same steps, for $y'\ll r$ factor out $r$ and for $y'\gg r$ factor out $y'$. For the case $r\gg y'$, the expansion should yield

$$\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}=\frac{1}{r}\left(1+\frac{y'}{r}\cos\gamma+\left(\frac{y'}{r}\right)^2\frac{1}{2}\left(3\cos^2\gamma-1\right)-\left(\frac{y'}{r}\right)^3\frac{3}{2}\cos\gamma+\frac{3}{8}\left(\frac{y'}{r}\right)^4...\right)$$

and one makes the identification that $r_{>}$ is $r$, $r_{<}$ is $y'$ and concludes that this is consistent with Jackson's equation 3.38.

----

Having done the derivation for charges at specific points, one can then follow the same steps to find the result for an arbitrary location in space $r'$ for the charge.

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|} &=\frac{1}{\sqrt{(x-x')^2+(y-y')^2+(z-z')^2}}\\
&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2+x'^2+y'^2+z'^2-2xx'-2yy'-2zz'}}\\
&=\frac{1}{r\sqrt{1+r'^2/r^2-2(xx'+yy'+zz')/r^2}}\\
&=\frac{1}{r\sqrt{1+r'^2/r^2-2(r'/r)\cos\gamma}}\\
\end{align}
$$

$$r^2=x^2+y^2+z^2$$

$$r'^2=x'^2+y'^2+z'^2$$

$$\cos\gamma=\frac{\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathbf{r'}}{rr'}=\frac{xx'+yy'+zz'}{rr'}$$

$$\delta = r'^2/r^2-2(r'/r)\cos\gamma$$

For $r \gg r'$,

$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\delta}}=1-\frac{1}{2}\delta+\frac{3}{8}\delta^2-\frac{5}{16}\delta^3+...$$

$$\frac{1}{r\sqrt{1+r'^2/r^2-2(r'/r)\cos\gamma}}=\frac{1}{r}\left(1+\frac{r'}{r}\cos\gamma+\left(\frac{r'}{r}\right)^2\frac{1}{2}\left(3\cos^2\gamma-1\right)+\left(\frac{r'}{r}\right)^3\frac{1}{2}\left(5\cos^3\gamma-3\cos\gamma\right)+...\right)$$

$$\frac{1}{r}\sum_{l=0}^\infty \left(\frac{r'}{r}\right)^l P_l(\cos \gamma)$$

This process can be repeated using $r' \gg r$ giving

$$\frac{1}{r'}\sum_{l=0}^\infty \left(\frac{r}{r'}\right)^l P_l(\cos \gamma)$$

The equations for $r \gg r'$ and $r'\gg r$ can be combined into one equation

$$\sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{r^l_{<}}{r^{l+1}_{>}}P_l(\cos \gamma)=\frac{1}{r_{>}}\sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{r^l_{<}}{r^l_{>}}P_l(\cos \gamma)$$

using the convention that $r_{>}$ is the larger of $r$ & $r'$ and $r_{<}$ is the smaller of $r$ and $r'$.

## Monopole Expansion Using the Azimuthal Symmetry Trick 

In section 3.3 of Jackson 3rd edition, he notes that for a problem with azimuthal symmetry, the general solution to Laplace's equation in spherical coordinates is

$$\psi(r,\theta)=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\left(A_lr^l + B_lr^{-l-1}\right)P_l(\cos\theta)$$

The coefficients $A_l$ and $B_l$ in the expansion can be found using a trick, provided that $\psi(z)$ is known as a power series for a charge distribution that is independent of the spherical angle $\phi$ (so $\psi$ has azimuthal symmetry). Using this trick, he finds $\psi(r,\theta)$ for a point charge at $\mathbf{x}'$ by noting that $\psi(z)$ for a charge located on the $z-$axis is easily converted to a power series using a Taylor series expansion. (He uses the same trick to find  $\psi(r,\theta)$ for a ring of charge in the $x-y$ plane and centered on the $z-$axis.)

1. In a few sentences, explain the justification for why the trick works.

2. Use the trick to find the coefficients $A_l$ and $B_l$ for a charge: $q$ at $z'= d$ using $kq=1$. (That is, repeat Jackson's derivation, but fill in the missing steps and write it in a way that makes sense to you.)

1.

The justification is that due to the uniqueness of solutions to Laplace's equation, there must exist a single solution (single set of coefficients $A_l$ and $B_l$) for all space in the general solution so the coefficients $a_l$ and $b_l$ in an expansion of the potential in the form of $\psi(z)=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty} a_lz^l + b_l/z^{l+1}$ that applies to the $z-$axis must be the same as $A_l$ and $B_l$. 

Suppose for a given charge configuration, one can find a solution for the potential on the $z$-axis as a power-series 

$$\psi(z)=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty} \left(a_lz^l + \frac{b_l}{z^{l+1}}\right)$$

and the charge configuration has azimuthal symmetry. The general solution to Laplace's equation for a potential that does not depend on $\phi$ is $\nabla^2\psi(r,\theta)=0$ is

$$\psi(r,\theta)=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\left(A_lr^l + B_lr^{-l-1}\right)P_l(\cos\theta)$$

Setting $r=z$, $\theta=0$, and noting that $P_l(1)=0$, this equation becomes

$$\psi(r=z,\theta=0)=\psi(z)=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\left(A_lz^l + B_lz^{-l-1}\right)$$

The equations for $\psi(z)$ in terms of $a_l$ & $b_l$ and $A_l$ & $B_l$ both satisfy Laplace's equation. If solutions to Laplace's equations are unique, then $A_l=a_l$ and $B_l=b_l$.
|}

## Dipole Expansion 

Point charges $q=\pm 1$ are located at $(x,y,z)=(0,0,\pm z')$ and $kq=1$.

Find the potential in three ways

1. Using the azimuthal symmetry trick
1. Using equation 3.38 of Jackson 3rd edition (quoted in a previous problem)
1. Using equation 3.95 of Griffiths 4th edition (quoted in a previous problem)

{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! align="left" |&nbsp;Solution

1.

First, consider the $z>0$ case, so $|z|=z$.

Using $q/4\pi\epsilon_o=1$

$$\psi(z)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{(z-z')^2}}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{(z+z')^2}}=\frac{1}{|z-z'|}-\frac{1}{|z+z'|}$$

For $z'\lt z$,

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{|z-z'|}=\frac{1}{|z|}\frac{1}{(1-z'/z)}&=\frac{1}{z}\left(1 + \frac{z'}{z} + \left(\frac{z'}{z}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{z'}{z}\right)^3 + \left(\frac{z'}{z}\right)^4 + ... \right)\\
\frac{1}{|z+z'|}=\frac{1}{|z|}\frac{1}{(1+z'/z)}&=\frac{1}{z}\left(1 - \frac{z'}{z} + \left(\frac{z'}{z}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{z'}{z}\right)^3 + \left(\frac{z'}{z}\right)^4 + ... \right)\\
\end{align}
$$

Combining these two equations gives

$$\psi(z)=\frac{1}{|z-z'|}-\frac{1}{|z+z|}=\frac{2z'}{z^2}+\frac{2z'^3}{z^4}+\frac{2z'^5}{z^6}+...$$

This is to be compared to the general solution to Laplace's equation 

$$\psi(r,\theta)=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\left(A_lr^l + B_lr^{-l-1}\right)P_l(\cos\theta)$$

for $\theta=0$. Using this, $r=z$, and $P_l(\cos 0)=P_l(1)=1$,

$$\psi(z)=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\left(A_lz^l + B_lz^{-l-1}\right)=A_o+A_1z+A_2z^2+...+\frac{B_o}{z}+\frac{B_1}{z^2}+\frac{B_2}{z^3}+\frac{B_3}{z^4}+...$$

If the two $\psi(z)$ potential equations are to match, $A_l=0$ for all $l$ and $B_1=2z'$, $B_3=2z'^3$, $B_5=2z'^5$, $...$ for $l=1,3,5,...$, and $B_l=0$ otherwise. 

$$
\begin{align}
\psi(\mathbf{x}) & = \frac{2z'}{r^2}P_1(\cos\theta)+\frac{2z'^3}{r^4}P_3(\cos\theta)+\frac{2z'^5}{r^6}P_5(\cos\theta)+...\\
& = \frac{2}{r}\sum_{l=0}^\infty \left(\frac{z'}{r}\right)^{2l+1}P_l(\cos\theta)
\end{align}
$$

When $z<z'$, a power series form of the potential can be found by repeating the above steps with $z$ and $z'$ interchanged. The result is then this last equation with $r$ and $z'$ swapped:

$$\psi(\mathbf{x})=\frac{2}{z'}\sum_{l=0}^\infty \left(\frac{r}{z'}\right)^{2l+1}P_l(\cos\theta)$$

Note that the above was done under the assumption that $z>0$. If $z < 0$, we would need to make two changes: (1) $|z|=-z$ and (2) $\theta=\pi$. The results are the same. However, this calculation actually does not need to be done or considered because we have already found a general solution.

2.

This could also have been shown using equation 3.38 of Jackson (shown here for $r>r'$)

$$\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x_+}|}=\sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{r^l_{+}}{r^{l+1}} P_l(\cos \gamma_+)$$

$$\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x_-}|}=\sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{r^l_{-}}{r^{l+1}} P_l(\cos \gamma_-)$$

Where  $r_{+}=r_{-}=z'$, $\gamma_+$ is the angle from the $+q$ charge at $\mathbf{x}_+ = z'\hat{\mathbf{z}}$ to $\mathbf{x}$ and $\gamma_-$ is the angle from the $-q$ charge at $\mathbf{x}_- = -z'\hat{\mathbf{z}}$ to $\mathbf{x}$.

Using, $\gamma_+ = \theta$, $\gamma_++\gamma_-=\pi \Rightarrow \gamma_-=\pi-\theta$, and $P_l(x)=-P_l(-x)$ for $l=1,3,...$ and $P_l(x) = P_l(-x)$ otherwise:

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x_+}'|}-\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x_-}'|} & = & \sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{z^{'l}}{r^{l+1}} P_l(\cos \theta)-\sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{z^{'l}}{r^{l+1}} P_l(\cos (\pi-\theta))\\
& = & \sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{z^{'l}}{r^{l+1}} \Big[P_l(\cos \theta) - P_l(\cos (\pi-\theta))\Big]\\
& = & \sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{z^{'l}}{r^{l+1}} \Big[P_l(\cos \theta) - P_l(-\cos \theta)\Big]\\
& = & \sum_{l=1,3,...}^\infty \frac{z^{'l}}{r^{l+1}} 2P_l(\cos \theta)\\
& = & \sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{z^{'2l+1}}{r^{2l+2}} 2P_l(\cos \theta)\\
& = & \frac{2}{r}\sum_{l=0}^\infty \left(\frac{z'}{r}\right)^{2l+1}P_l(\cos\theta)
\end{eqnarray}$$

For $r < z'$, all of the above steps apply and the result is the above equation with $r$ and $z'$ swapped.

3. 

In this case, the charge density in primed coordinates is (using $d\equiv z'$ to avoid issue noted in problem 1)

$$\rho({\mathbf{r}}')=q\delta(x')\delta(y')\delta(z'-d)-q\delta(x')\delta(y')\delta(z'+d)$$

or

$$\rho({\mathbf{r}}')=\frac{q}{2\pi r'^2\sin\theta'}\delta(r'-d)\delta(\theta')-\frac{q}{2\pi r'^2\sin\theta'}\delta(r'-d)\delta(\theta'-\pi)$$

The following charge density could also be used

$$\rho({\mathbf{r}}')=\frac{q}{r'^2\sin\theta'}\delta(r'-d)\delta(\theta')\delta(\phi')-\frac{q}{r'^2\sin\theta'}\delta(r'-d)\delta(\theta'-\pi)\delta(\phi')$$

(In fact, we could use $\delta(\phi'-\delta)$, where $\delta$ is arbitrary.)

As noted in class, one should check that this charge density gives $\int \rho(\mathbf{r}')r'^2\sin\theta'dr'd\theta'd\phi'=q-q$. Also note that the second term has $\delta(r'-d)$ and not $\delta(r'+d)$, which is a common error; $r'$ must be greater than zero, so $\delta(r'+d)$ corresponds to a charge at $r'=-d$.

In general, $\alpha$ depends on the primed coordinates

$$\cos \alpha = \frac{\mathbf{r}\cdot \mathbf{r}'}{r\thinspacer'}=\sin\theta\sin\theta'\cos\phi\cos\phi' + \sin\theta\sin\theta'\sin\phi\sin\phi'+\cos\theta\cos\theta'$$

which can also be written as

$$\cos \alpha = \sin\theta\sin\theta'\cos(\phi-\phi') +\cos\theta\cos\theta'$$

We need to evaluate

$$\psi(\mathbf{r})=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{r^{n+1}}\int(r')^nP_n(\cos\alpha)\rho(\mathbf{r}')d\tau'$$

In spherical coordinates, $d\tau'=r'^2\sin\theta'dr'd\theta'd\phi'$. The integral to evaluate is 

$$\int(r')^nP_n(\cos\alpha)\left[\frac{q}{2\pi r'^2\sin\theta'}\delta(r'-d)\delta(\theta')-\frac{q}{2\pi r'^2\sin\theta'}\delta(r'-d)\delta(\theta'-\pi)\right]r'^2\sin\theta'dr'd\theta'd\phi'$$

After cancellation

$$\frac{q}{2\pi}\int(r')^nP_n(\cos\alpha)\left[\delta(r'-d)\delta(\theta')-\delta(r'-d)\delta(\theta'-\pi)\right]dr'd\theta'd\phi'$$

Integration over $r'$ gives

$$\frac{q}{2\p\thinspace d^{\thinspacen}\int P_n(\cos\alpha)\left[\delta(\theta')-\delta(\theta'-\pi)\right]d\theta'd\phi'$$

Recalling that

$$\cos \alpha = \sin\theta\sin\theta'\cos(\phi-\phi') +\cos\theta\cos\theta'$$

and using

$$P_l(\cos\alpha)\delta(\theta') = P_l(\sin(\theta)\sin 0\cos(\phi-\phi')+\cos\theta\cos 0)=P_l(\cos\theta)$$

$$P_l(\cos\alpha)\delta(\theta-\pi) = P_l(\sin(\theta)\sin 0\cos(\phi-\phi')+\cos\theta\cos \pi)=P_l(-\cos \theta)$$

allows the integration over $\theta$ to be evaluated as

$$\frac{q}{2\p\thinspace d^{\thinspacen}\int P_n(\cos\alpha)\left[\delta(\theta')-\delta(\theta'-\pi)\right]d\theta'=\frac{q}{2\pi}d^{\thinspacen}[P_n(\cos\theta)-P_n(-\cos\theta)]\int d\phi'$$

Integration over $\phi'$ leaves

$\thinspace d^{\thinspacen}[P_n(\cos\theta)-P_n(-\cos\theta)]$$

Thus, 

$$\psi(\mathbf{r})=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{r^{n+1}}\int(r')^nP_n(\cos\alpha)\rho(\mathbf{r}')d\tau'$$

simplifies to

$$\psi(\mathbf{r})=\frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{d^{\thinspacen}}{r^{n+1}}[P_n(\cos\theta)-P_n(-\cos\theta)]$$

for $\pm q$ at $z=\pm d$

The $n=0, 2, ...$ Legendre polynomials are even functions, so $P_n(x)=P_n(-x)$. The $n=1, 3, ...$ Legendre polynomials are odd functions, os $P_n(x)=-P_n(-x)$. As a result, 

$$\psi(\mathbf{r})=\frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\sum_{n=1,3,...}^{\infty}\frac{d^{\thinspacen}}{r^{n+1}}[2P_n(\cos\theta)]$$

or, using $n=2l+1$ and switching replacing $d$ with $z'$

$$\psi(\mathbf{r})=\frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\frac{z'^{2l+1}}{r^{2l+2}}[2P_l(\cos\theta)]=\frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{2}{r}\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{z'}{r}\right)^{2l+1}P_l(\cos\theta)$$

which matches the earlier results. This process can be repeated for $r\lt z'$ and the result is the above equation with $r$ and $z'$ swapped.

## Long Rectangular Tube with Sheet of Charge 

An infinitely long, hollow, and conducting rectangular tube is parallel to the $z$-axis and has sides bounded by $0\le x \le 1$ and $0\le y\le 1$. All sides are grounded.

A infinitely long non-conducting sheet of charge with surface charge density $\sigma'$ is in the $x=x'$ plane between $y=0$ and $y=1$. See the left part of the figure below.

[[Image:Tubes.png|400px]]

1. 

Find equations $\psi_l(x,y)$, the potential for $x\lt x'$, and $\psi_r(x,y)$, the potential for $x\gt x'$. In class, I showed that 

$$\psi_l=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}A_n\sin(n\pi y)\sinh(n\pi x)$$

$$\psi_r=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}B_n\sin(n\pi y)\sinh(n\pi(x-1))$$

where $n$ is an integer, matches the boundary conditions on the walls of the conductor. You need to find $A_n$ and $B_n$ such that the two conditions

$$\psi_l(x',y)=\psi_r(x',y)$$

and

$$\left[-\frac{\partial \psi_r}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial \psi_l}{\partial x}\right]_{x=x'}=\frac{\sigma'}{\epsilon_o}$$

are satisfied.

2.

Write a single equation for the potential $\psi(x,y)$ using $\psi_l$, $\psi_r$, and the Heavyside step function $\Theta$.

The Green function is $G=(4\pi\epsilon_o/A\sigma')\psi$, where $A=\int_0^1dy\int_{0}^L dz$ and $L$ is the length of the tube. (You do not need to show this as you did in the previous homework.)

3.

Use the Green function to find the potential when the tube is filled with a nonconducting material with a uniform charge density $\rho_o$ as shown in the right part of the figure above.

----

Notes:

* I suggest that you work through examples 3.3 and 3.4 of Griffiths before attempting part 1. In those examples, there is no conducting sheet and one of the sides is at a fixed potential. However, the procedure needed for the second condition in part 1. is similar.
* In problem 2.15 of Jackson, he gives the Green function for the case where a line of charge parallel to the $z$-axis passes through $(x,y)=(x',y')$. That problem is a bit more complicated than the problem considered here. In problem 2.16, of Jackson, he states the result of using the Green function from problem 2.15 to find the potential for the configuration in part 3. above.

1.

Both

$$\psi_l=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}A_n\sin(n\pi y)\sinh(n\pi x)$$

$$\psi_r=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}B_n\sin(n\pi y)\sinh(n\pi(x-1))$$

satisfy $\partial^2 \psi/\partial^2 x+\partial^2 \psi/\partial^2 y=0$. Also,

$$\psi_l(0,y)=0$$

$$\psi_l(x,0)=0$$

$$\psi_l(x,1)=0$$

$$\psi_r(1,y)=0$$

$$\psi_r(x,0)=0$$

$$\psi_r(x,1)=0$$

The equations for $\psi_l$ and $\psi_r$ could have been derived using the above six boundary equations and starting with 

$$\psi_l=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sin(n\pi y)\Big[A_n\sinh(n\pi x)+a_n\cosh(n\pi x)\Big]$$

$$\psi_r=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sin(n\pi y)\Big[B_n\sinh(n\pi x)+b_n\cosh(n\pi x)\Big]$$

or most generally

$$\psi_l=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\Big[A^l_n\sin(n\pi y)+B^l_n\cos(n\pi y)\Big]\Big[C^l_n\sinh(n\pi x)+D^l_n\cosh(n\pi x)\Big]$$

$$\psi_r=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\Big[A^r_n\sin(n\pi y)+B^r_n\cos(n\pi y)\Big]\Big[C^r_n\sinh(n\pi x)+D^r_n\cosh(n\pi x)\Big]$$

However, the result will be the same. In problems such as these, it is often easier to reason out what the form of the solution will be rather than starting from the most general equation. In this case, we need the $\sin$ solution in the $y$ direction because it can have zeros at two locations. The $\sinh(n\pi(x-1))$ term is justified because we know that $a\sinh x$ and $b\cosh x$ can be combined into a $C\sinh (x + \delta)$ with a "phase" shift $\delta$.

The continuity condition

$$\psi_l(x',y)=\psi_r(x',y)$$

gives

$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}A_n\sin(n\pi y)\sinh(n\pi x') = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}B_n\sin(n\pi y)\sinh(n\pi(x'-1))$$

It follows that

$$B_n = \frac{\sinh(n\pi x')}{\sinh(n\pi(x'-1))}A_n$$

The jump condition

$$\left[-\frac{\partial \psi_r}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial \psi_l}{\partial x}\right]_{x=x'}=\frac{\sigma'}{\epsilon_o}$$

gives

$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(n\pi)\sin(n\pi y)\Big[- B_n\cosh(n\pi(x'-1))+A_n\cosh(n\pi x')\Big]=\frac{\sigma'}{\epsilon_o}$$

The term in square brackets

$$- B_n\cosh(n\pi(x'-1)) + A_n\cosh(n\pi x') $$

rewritten using the continuity relationship $B_n = A_n\sinh(n\pi x')/\sinh(n\pi(x'-1))$ is

$$A_n\left[\cosh(n\pi x')-\frac{\sinh(n\pi x')\cosh(n\pi(x'-1))}{\sinh(n\pi(x'-1))}\right]$$

or

$$A_n\frac{\sinh(n\pi(x'-1))\cosh(n\pi x')-\sinh(n\pi x')\cosh(n\pi(x'-1))]}{\sinh(n\pi(x'-1))}$$

The numerator simplifies to $\sinh(-n\pi)=-\sinh(n\pi)$. This can be seen by expanding the hyperbolic functions as exponentials or using the identity

$$\sinh(\alpha-\beta)=\sinh(\alpha)\cosh(\beta)-\sinh(\beta)\cosh(\alpha)$$

with $\alpha = n\pi (x' - 1)$ and $\beta = n\pi x'$.

The continuity condition equation thus simplifies to

$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \sin(n\pi y)\left[\frac{n\pi\sinh(n\pi)}{\sinh(n\pi(x'-1))}\right]=-\frac{\sigma'}{\epsilon_o}$$

Multiplication of this by $\sin(l\pi y) dy$ and integration from $y=0$ to $1$ and using

$$\int_0^1\sin(l\pi y)\sin(n\pi y) dy=0\qquad\mbox{ for }l\ne n$$

$$\int_0^1\sin(l\pi y)\sin(n\pi y) dy=\frac{1}{2}\qquad\mbox{ for }l=n$$

$$\int_0^1\sin(l\pi y) dy=\frac{2}{l\pi}\quad\mbox{ for }l=1, 3, 5, ...$$

gives (after changing the dummy index from $l$ to $n$),

$$A_n = - \frac{4\sigma'}{n^2\pi^2\epsilon_o}\frac{\sinh(n\pi(x'-1))}{\sinh(n\pi)}$$

$$B_n = - \frac{4\sigma'}{n^2\pi^2\epsilon_o}\frac{\sinh(n\pi x')}{\sinh(n\pi)}$$

for $n=1, 3, 5, ...$ and $A_n=B_l=0$ for $n = 2, 4, ...$.

$$\psi_l = -\sum_{n=1,3,...}^{\infty} \frac{4\sigma'}{n^2\pi^2\epsilon_o}\frac{1}{\sinh(n\pi)}\sinh(n\pi(x'-1))\sinh(n\pi x)\sin(n\pi y)$$

$$\psi_r= -\sum_{n=1,3,...}^{\infty} \frac{4\sigma'}{n^2\pi^2\epsilon_o}\frac{1}{\sinh(n\pi)}\sinh(n\pi x')\sinh(n\pi (x-1))\sin(n\pi y)$$

or, using $-\sinh(x)=\sinh(x)$ and defining $x_{\lt}$ to the the smaller of $x$ and $x'$ and $x_{\gt}$ to the the larger of $x$ and $x'$,

$$\psi =  \sum_{n=1,3,...}^{\infty} \frac{4\sigma'}{n^2\pi^2\epsilon_o}\frac{1}{\sinh(n\pi)}\sinh(n\pi(1-x_{\gt}))\sinh(n\pi x_{\lt})\sin(n\pi y)$$

or, in terms of $\Theta$,

$$\psi = \psi_l\Theta(x'-x)+\psi_r\Theta(x-x')$$

2.

Using $G=(4\pi\epsilon_o/A\sigma')\psi$ gives

$$G = \frac{4\pi\epsilon_o}{A\sigma'}\Big[\psi_l\Theta(x'-x)+\psi_r\Theta(x-x')\Big]$$

3.

For reasons similar to that in the problem in HW #5, the surface integral is zero and equation 1.44 of Jackson reduces to 

$$\Psi(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\int_{\mathcal V} G(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}') \rho(\mathbf{x}')d^3x$$

$G$ does not depend on $y'$ or $z'$ and $\rho=\rho_o=const$, so

$$\Psi(x) = \frac{A}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\int_0^1 G(x,x') \rho\thinspace dx'$$

where $A$ is as defined in the problem statement.

$$\Psi(x) = \frac{\rho_o}{\sigma'}\int_0^1  \Big[\psi_l\Theta(x'-x)+\psi_r\Theta(x-x')\Bi\thinspace dx'$$

$$\Psi(x) = \frac{\rho_o}{\sigma'}\int_x^1  \psi\thinspace dx'+\frac{\rho_o}{\sigma'}\int_0^x  \psi\thinspace dx'$$

The first integral requires the integration

$$\int_x^1\sinh(n\pi(x'-1\thinspace dx'=\frac{\cosh(0)-\cosh(n\pi(x-1))}{n\pi}$$

The second integral requires the integration

$$\int_0^x\sinh(n\pi x\thinspace dx'=\frac{\cosh(n\pi x)-\cosh(0)}{n\pi}$$

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\Psi(x) & = & -\frac{4}{\epsilon_o\pi^3}\sum_{n=1,3,5,...}^{\infty}  \frac{\sinh(n\pi y)}{n^3\sinh(n\pi)}\times \\
& &\Big[\sinh(n\pi x)(1-\cosh[n\pi (x-1)])+\sinh[n\pi(x-1)](\cosh(n\pi x)-1))\Big]
\end{eqnarray}
$$

Using again

$$\sinh(\alpha-\beta)=\sinh(\alpha)\cosh(\beta)-\sinh(\beta)\cosh(\alpha)$$

with $\alpha=n\pi(x-1)$ and $\beta=n\pi$

$$\Psi(x) = -\frac{4}{\epsilon_o\pi^3}\sum_{n=1,3,5,...}^{\infty} \frac{\sinh(n\pi y)}{n^3\sinh(n\pi)}\Big[-\sin(n\pi)+\sinh(n\pi x)+\sinh[n\pi(x-1)]\Big]$$

To combine $\sinh(n\pi x)+\sinh[n\pi(x-1)$ into one term, note that when expanded in terms of exponentials the following sum has four terms

$$\sinh(u)+\sinh(u-1) = \frac{1}{2}\left(e^u-e^{-u}+e^{u-1}+e^{-(u-1)}\right)$$

The following product has four terms

$$\cosh\alpha\sinh\beta = \frac{1}{4}\left(e^{\alpha+\beta}-e^{-(\alpha+\beta)}+e^{\alpha-\beta}-e^{-(\alpha-\beta)}\right)$$

Setting

$$\alpha + \beta = u$$

and

$$\alpha-\beta=u-1$$

gives $\alpha = u-1/2$ and $\beta=1/2$.

Thus

$$\sinh(n\pi x)+\sinh[n\pi(x-1)] = 2\cosh[n\pi(x-1/2)]\sinh(n\pi/2)$$

and

$$\frac{-\sin(n\pi)+\sinh(n\pi x)+\sinh[n\pi(x-1)]}{\sinh(n\pi)}=\Big[-1+\frac{\sinh(n\pi/2)}{\sinh(n\pi)}2\cosh[n\pi(x-1/2)]\Big]$$

Finally, using

$$\sin(2x)=2\cosh(x)\sinh(x) \Rightarrow \sinh(x)=2\cosh(x/2)\sinh(x/2)$$

gives 

$$\frac{\sinh(x/2)}{\sinh(x)}=\frac{1}{2\cosh(x/2)}$$

and the final result of

$$\Psi = \frac{4}{\pi^3\epsilon_o}\sum_{n=1,3,...}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(n\pi y)}{n^3}\left[1-\frac{\cosh[n\pi(x-1/2)]}{\cosh(n\pi/2)}\right]$$

Defining $m = (n-1)/2$ gives the result of problem 2.16 of Jackson.

# HW 7 

Due April 1st before class starts. Send a scanned PDF attached to an email.

A note on grading. On problems where I have you build towards a solution, I have noticed that some students take the path of omitting justifications for key (and highly non-obvious) steps. When grading, I'm looking for evidence that you understand things. And if you write the problem statement, one intermediate equation and then the solution, I can't tell what you understand. If you don't know why a step is needed, say so or ask, otherwise, it often seems that you are trying to hoodwink me. The motivation for giving an answer to some problems is so that you can figure out the intermediate justifications, many of which are non-trivial.

In the solutions, steps that were frequently not addressed in student solutions are indicated by !!! in my solution.
 
## Long Tube 

1. Do problem HW problem 6.4 with the modification that $\sigma'=\lambda'\delta(y-y')$ and show that you get the result quoted in problem 2.15(b) of Jackson.
1. Use the Green function from part 1. and equation 1.44 of Jackson to find the potential inside the tube when $\rho=0$ inside the tube, the side at $x=1$ is held at a potential of $V_o$, and the other three sides are grounded.

1.

The steps used to derive

$$B_n = \frac{\sinh(n\pi x')}{\sinh(n\pi(x'-1))}A_n$$

and

$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \sin(n\pi y)\left[\frac{n\pi\sinh(n\pi)}{\sinh(n\pi(x'-1))}\right]=-\frac{\sigma'}{\epsilon_o}$$

in HW 6.4 are unchanged. For this problem, replace $\sigma'$ with $\sigma'=\lambda'\delta(y-y')$.

$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \sin(n\pi y)\left[\frac{n\pi\sinh(n\pi)}{\sinh(n\pi(x'-1))}\right]=-\frac{\lambda'\delta(y-y')}{\epsilon_o}$$

Multiplication of this by $\sin(l\pi y) dy$ and integration from $y=0$ to $1$ and using

$$\int_0^1\sin(l\pi y)\sin(n\pi y) dy=0\qquad\mbox{ for }l\ne n$$

$$\int_0^1\sin(l\pi y)\sin(n\pi y) dy=\frac{1}{2}\qquad\mbox{ for }l=n$$

$$\int_0^1\sin(l\pi y) \delta(y-y') dy=\sin(l\pi y')$$

gives, after changing the dummy index from $l$ to $n$,

$$A_n = - \frac{2\lambda'}{n\pi\epsilon_o}\frac{\sinh(n\pi(x'-1))}{\sinh(n\pi)}\sin(n\pi y')$$

$$B_n = - \frac{2\lambda'}{n\pi \epsilon_o}\frac{\sinh(n\pi x')}{\sinh(n\pi)}\sin(n\pi y')$$

for $n=1, 2, 3 , ...$. Note that $n$ is not constrained to be odd as it was in HW 6.4. The new result is

$$\psi_l = -\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2\lambda'}{n\pi\epsilon_o}\frac{1}{\sinh(n\pi)}\sinh[n\pi(x'-1)]\sinh(n\pi x)\sin(n\pi y)\sin(n\pi y')$$

$$\psi_r= -\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2\lambda'}{n\pi\epsilon_o}\frac{1}{\sinh(n\pi)}\sinh(n\pi x')\sinh[n\pi (x-1)]\sin(n\pi y)\sin(n\pi y')$$

or, using $-\sinh(x)=\sinh(-x)$ and defining $x_{\lt}$ to the the smaller of $x$ and $x'$ and $x_{\gt}$ to the the larger of $x$ and $x'$,

$$\psi =  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2\lambda'}{n\pi\epsilon_o}\frac{1}{\sinh(n\pi)}\sinh[n\pi(1-x_{\gt})]\sinh(n\pi x_{\lt})\sin(n\pi y)\sin(n\pi y')$$

Using $G=(4\pi\epsilon_o/L_z\lambda')\psi$ gives

$$G =  8\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}\frac{1}{\sinh(n\pi)}\sinh[n\pi(1-x_{\gt})]\sinh(n\pi x_{\lt})\sin(n\pi y)\sin(n\pi y')$$

<code>!!!</code>This is the same equation as problem 2.15 of Jackson except that the $x$ and $y$ variables are swapped. Given the fact that the problem is unchanged if the coordinates on the diagram for HW 6.4 are swapped, we are free to change replace $x$ with $y$ and vice-versa in our equation above and so we conclude that it follows from this symmetry that

$$G =  8\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}\frac{1}{\sinh(n\pi)}\sinh[n\pi(1-y_{\gt})]\sinh(n\pi y_{\lt})\sin(n\pi x)\sin(n\pi x')$$

Alternatively, the equivalence can be proved using an identity such as equation 3.169 of Jackson.

2.

----
First, obtain an answer using the standard boundary value method. The potential

$$\psi = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}A_n\sin(n\pi y)\sinh(n\pi x)$$

satisfies the there boundary conditions for which the potential on the boundary is zero.

To determine $A_n$, multiply both sides by $\sin(l\pi y)$ and integrate from $y=0$ to $y=1$. This gives

$$A_n=\frac{4V_o}{n\pi}\frac{1}{\sinh(n\pi)}\quad n=1,3,...$$

$$A_n=0\quad n=2,4,...$$

and so

$$\psi = \sum_{n=1,3,...}^{\infty}\frac{4V_o}{n\pi}\frac{1}{\sinh(n\pi)}\sinh(n\pi x)\sin(n\pi y)$$

----

We need to compute

$$\Phi(x,y) = -\frac{1}{4\pi}\oint_\mathcal{S} \Phi(x,x',y,'y) \frac{\partial G}{\partial n'}\Bigg|_{\mathcal{S}} da'$$

<code>!!!</code>The surface $\mathcal{S}$ is the surface of the volume $\mathcal{V}$, which is the volume inside the tube. $\mathcal{S}$ has a cross-sectional area of 1x1 and a length of $L_z$. On the two open ends of the tube, $n'=\pm z'$ and $\partial G/\partial z'=0$. On three of the sides of the volume, $\Phi=0$. This leaves the side at $x=1$ which has an outward normal of $n=x$. The integration needed is thus

$$\Phi(x,y) = -\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_0^1\int_0^{L_z} \Phi(1,x,y,y') \frac{\partial G}{\partial x'}\Bigg|_{x'=1} dy'dz'$$

Using $\Phi(1,x,y,y')=V_o$ and integration over $z'$ gives $L_z$, so

$$\Phi(x,y) = -\frac{V_oL_z}{4\pi}\int_0^1\frac{\partial G}{\partial x'}\Bigg|_{x'=1} dy'$$

Using the relationship

$$G=\frac{4\pi\epsilon_o}{L_z\lambda'}\psi$$

this is

$$\Phi(x,y) = -\frac{V_oL_z}{4\pi}\frac{4\pi\epsilon_o}{L_z\lambda'}\int_0^1\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x'}\Bigg|_{x'=1} dy'$$

Using $\psi = \psi_l\Theta(x'-x)+\psi_r\Theta(x-x')$,

$$\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x'}\Bigg|_{x'=1}= \Theta(1-x)\frac{\partial \psi_l}{\partial x'}\Bigg|_{x'=1}+\Theta(x-1)\frac{\partial \psi_r}{\partial x'}\Bigg|_{x'=1}$$

<code>!!!</code>The two terms other items in $\partial \psi/\partial x'$ involving the derivative of $\Theta$ cancel; this was considered in a previous HW problem. The second term in this equation is zero because the volume extends from $x=0$ to $x=1$. For this range of $x$, $\Theta(1-x) = 1$. This leaves

$$\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x'}\Bigg|_{x'=1}= \frac{\partial \psi_l}{\partial x'}\Bigg|_{x'=1}$$

Using

$$\psi_l = -\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2\lambda'}{n\pi\epsilon_o}\frac{1}{\sinh(n\pi)}\sinh[n\pi(x'-1)]\sinh(n\pi x)\sin(n\pi y)\sin(n\pi y')$$

gives

$$\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x'}\Bigg|_{x'=1}= -\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2\lambda'}{\epsilon_o}\frac{1}{\sinh(n\pi)}\cosh(0)\sinh(n\pi 
x)\sin(n\pi y)\sin(n\pi y')$$

and the integral

$$\Phi(x,y) = -\frac{V_oL_z}{4\pi}\frac{4\pi\epsilon_o}{L_z\lambda'}\int_0^1\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x'}\Bigg|_{x'=1} dy'$$

can be rewritten as

$$\Phi(x,y) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{2V_o}{\sinh(n\pi)}\sinh(n\pi x)\sin(n\pi y)\int_0^1 \sin(n\pi y')  dy'$$

The integral is zero for $n=2, 4, ...$ and $2/n\pi$ for $n=1,3,...$. The final result is then

$$\Phi(x,y) = \sum_{n=1,3,...}^{\infty}\frac{4V_o}{n\pi}\frac{1}{\sinh(n\pi)}\sinh(n\pi x)\sin(n\pi y)$$

which is the same as the result found earlier.

## Sphere 

1. Show the steps required to obtain equation 3.114 from equation 2.16 (both in Jackson 3rd edition).
1. Show that equation 3.114 can be obtained using the same technique used to find the Green function in the previous problem (the Long Tube problem). Do this by assuming a shell of charge at $r=r'$ with density $\sigma'(\theta,\phi)$ and finding the potential in two regions: $a \le r \lt r'$ and $r\gt r'$. To obtain 3.114 of Jackson, you will need to use $\sigma'(\theta,\phi)=q\delta(\cos\theta-\cos\theta')\delta(\phi-\phi')/4\pi r'^2$.
1. Use equation 3.114 and equation 1.44 of Jackson to find the potential outside of a sphere of radius $a$ for which the upper hemisphere ($z\gt 0$) is held at a potential of $V_o$ and the lower hemisphere ($z\lt 0$) is held at $-V_o$.

1.

Equation 2.16 is

$$G(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')=\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}  - \frac{a}{x'}\frac{1}{\left|\mathbf{x}-\frac{a^2}{x'^2}\mathbf{x}'\right|}$$

where $x'\equiv |\mathbf{x}'|$ and so it has the same meaning as $r'$ used in Chapter 3. I am not sure why he did not use $r'$ in equation 2.16 and in Chapter 3 he switches to using $|\mathbf{x}'|=r'$. (This is why using a vector named $\mathbf{x}$ is an awkward choice of notation. When using cartesian coordinates is $x$ $|\mathbf{x}|$ or $\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$?)

The first term in $G$ is the same as equation 3.70:

$$\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|} = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \sum_{m=-l}^l \frac{4\pi}{2l+1}\frac{r_\lt^{l}}{r_\gt^{l+1}}Y^*_{lm}(\theta',\phi')Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)$$

Treating the second term requires some effort. First, define $\mathbf{y}\equiv (a^2/r'^2)\mathbf{x}'$ so that $|\mathbf{y}|=(a^2/r'^2)|\mathbf{x}'|=a^2/r'$.

<code>!!!</code>Next, consider $\frac{1}{\left|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}'\right|}$. The angle between $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}'$ is the same as the angle between  $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{x}'$ because $\mathbf{y}'$ is a multiple of $\mathbf{x}'$. For this reason, the primed angular terms will be the same as in equation 3.70. Whe using equation 3.70, there are two cases

$$r\gt |\mathbf{y}'|\quad\Rightarrow\quad r \gt \frac{a^2}{r'}\quad\text{or}\quad rr'\gt a^2$$

In this case, $r_{\gt}=r$ and $r_{\lt} = a^2/r'$.

The other case is

$$r\lt |\mathbf{y}'|\quad\Rightarrow\quad r \lt \frac{a^2}{r'}\quad\text{or}\quad rr'\lt a^2$$

In this case, $r_{\gt}=a^2/r'$ and $r_{\lt} = r$.

The Green function applies to two domains: $0\le r\le a$ and $r \gt a$ and $r'$ covers the same domain as $r$.

We want the Green function for the domain $r \gt a$, which corresponds to the case $rr'\gt a^2$ for which $r_{\gt}=r$ and $r_{\lt} = a^2/r'$. Therefore, for $r\gt a$, $1/\left|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}'\right|$

is

$$\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}'|} = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \sum_{m=-l}^l \frac{4\pi}{2l+1}\frac{(a^2/r')^{l}}{r^{l+1}}Y^*_{lm}(\theta',\phi')Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)$$

and so

$$G(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')=\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}  - \frac{a}{r'}\frac{1}{\left|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}'\right|} $$

is

$$G(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')= \sum_{l=0}^\infty \sum_{m=-l}^l \frac{4\pi}{2l+1}\left(\frac{r_\lt^{l}}{r_\gt^{l+1}}-\frac{a}{r'}\frac{(a^2/r')^{l}}{r^{l+1}}\right)Y^*_{lm}(\theta',\phi')Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)$$

or

$$G(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')= 4\pi\sum_{l,m} \frac{1}{2l+1}\left[\frac{r_\lt^{l}}{r_\gt^{l+1}}-\frac{1}{a}\left(\frac{a^2}{rr'}\right)^{l+1}\right]Y^*_{lm}(\theta',\phi')Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)$$

2.

The general solution to $\nabla^2\Phi(r,\theta,\phi)=0$ is

$$\Phi(r,\theta,\phi)=\sum_{l,m}^l \left(A_{lm}r^l+\frac{B_{lm}}{r^{l+1}}\right)Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)$$

$\nabla^2\Phi(r,\theta,\phi)=0$ in two regions: the inner, $i$, for which $a\le r\lt r'$ and the outer, $o$, for which $r\gt r'$

In order to match the boundary condition that $\Phi^o(r\rightarrow\infty,\theta,\phi)\rightarrow 0$, the constants for $r^l$ must be zero, so the equation in the outer region simplifies to

$$\Phi^o(r,\theta,\phi)=\sum_{l,m} \frac{B^o_{lm}}{r^{l+1}}Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)$$

The inner solution is

$$\Phi^i(r,\theta,\phi)=\sum_{l,m} \left(A^i_{lm}r^l+\frac{B^i_{lm}}{r^{l+1}}\right)Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)$$

The boundary condition $\Phi^i(a,\theta,\phi)=0$ gives

$$1.\quad B^i_{lm}=-A^i_{lm}a^{2l+1}$$

The continuity condition $\Phi^i(r',\theta,\phi)=\Phi^o(r',\theta,\phi)$ gives

$$B_{lm}^o=A_{lm}^ir'^{2l+1}+B_{lm}^i$$

which, when combined with 1. gives

$$2.\quad B^o_{lm}=A^i_{lm}\left(r'^{2l+1}-a^{2l+1}\right)$$

And so the inner potential simplifies to

$$\Phi^i(r,\theta,\phi)=\sum_{l,m} A^i_{lm}\left(r^l-\frac{a^{2l+1}}{r^{l+1}}\right)Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)$$

At this point, $\Phi^o$ will be kept in terms of $B^o_{lm}$. The jump condition is

$$\frac{\sigma'}{\epsilon_o}=\left[-\frac{\partial \Phi^o}{\partial r}+\frac{\partial \Phi^i}{\partial r}\right]_{r=r'}$$

With

$$\frac{\partial \Phi^o}{\partial r}=\sum_{l,m}-(l+1)\frac{B^o_{lm}}{r^{l+2}}Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)$$

and

$$\frac{\partial \Phi^i}{\partial r}=\sum_{l,m} A^i_{lm}\left(lr^{l-1}+(l+1)\frac{a^{2l+1}}{r^{l+2}}\right)Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)$$

the jump condition is

$$\frac{\sigma'}{\epsilon_o}=\sum_{l,m}\left[(l+1)\frac{B^o_{lm}}{r'^{l+2}}+\left(lr'^{l-1}+(l+1)\frac{a^{2l+1}}{r'^{l+2}}\right)A^i_{lm}\right]$$

where $\sigma'(\theta,\phi)=q\delta(\cos\theta-\cos\theta')\delta(\phi-\phi')/4\pi r'^2$ from the problem statement.

Multiply both sides by $Y^*_{l'm'}(\theta,\phi)d\Omega$ and integrate over the solid angle. The left-hand-side is

$$
\begin{array}
&\displaystyle\int \frac{\sigma'}{\epsilon_o}Y^*_{l'm'}(\theta,\phi)d\Omega & = \displaystyle\int \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_o r'^2}\delta(\cos\theta-\cos\theta')\delta(\phi-\phi') Y^*_{l'm'}(\theta,\phi)d(\cos\theta) d\phi\\
& =\frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_or'^2}Y^*_{l'm'}(\theta',\phi')
\end{array}
$$

The right-hand-side is

$$\sum_{l,m}\left[(l+1)\frac{B^o_{lm}}{r'^{l+2}}+\left(lr'^{l-1}+(l+1)\frac{a^{2l+1}}{r'^{l+2}}\right)A^i_{lm}\right]\int Y^*_{l'm'}Y^*_{lm}d\Omega$$

With, $\int Y^*_{l'm'}Y^*_{lm}d\Omega=\delta_{ll'}\delta_{mm'}$, it reduces to

$$(l+1)\frac{B^o_{l'm'}}{r'^{l+2}}+\left(lr'^{l-1}+(l+1)\frac{a^{2l+1}}{r'^{l+2}}\right)A^i_{l'm'}$$

This leaves

$$\frac{Y^*_{lm}(\theta',\phi')}{4\pi\epsilon_or'^2}=(l+1)\frac{B^o_{lm}}{r'^{l+2}}-\left(lr'^{l-1}+(l+1)\frac{a^{2l+1}}{r'^{l+2}}\right)A^i_{lm}$$

Using the relationship found earlier

$$2.\quad B^o_{lm}=A^i_{lm}\left(r'^{2l+1}-a^{2l+1}\right)$$

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{Y^*_{lm}(\theta',\phi')}{4\pi\epsilon_or'^2} & =(l+1)\frac{A^i_{lm}\left(r'^{2l+1}+a^{2l+1}\right)}{r'^{l+2}}-\left(lr'^{l-1}+(l+1)\frac{a^{2l+1}}{r'^{l+2}}\right)A^i_{lm}\\
& = \left[(l+1)\frac{\left(r'^{2l+1}-a^{2l+1}\right)}{r'^{l+2}}+\left(lr'^{l-1}+(l+1)\frac{a^{2l+1}}{r'^{l+2}}\right)\right]A^i_{lm}\\
& = \left[(l+1)\frac{r'^{2l+1}}{r'^{l+2}}+lr'^{l-1}\right]A^i_{lm}\\
& =A_{lm}^i(2l+1)r'^{l-1}\\
\end{align}
$$

Thus,

$$A_{lm}^i = \frac{qY^*_{lm}(\theta',\phi')}{4\pi\epsilon_o(2l+1)r'^{l+1}}$$

Using 1. and 2. gives

$$B_{lm}^i = -\frac{qY^*_{lm}(\theta',\phi')}{4\pi\epsilon_o(2l+1)r'^{l+1}}a^{2l+1} \qquad \quad B_{lm}^o = \frac{qY^*_{lm}(\theta',\phi')}{4\pi\epsilon_o(2l+1)r'^{l+1}}(r'^{2l+1}-a^{2l+1})$$

Using these in the equations for $\Phi$ that we left off with of

$$\Phi^i(r,\theta,\phi)=\sum_{l,m} A^i_{lm}\left(r^l-\frac{a^{2l+1}}{r^{l+1}}\right)Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)$$

$$\Phi^o(r,\theta,\phi)=\sum_{l,m} \frac{B^o_{lm}}{r^{l+1}}Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)$$

gives

$$\Phi^i(r,\theta,\phi)=\sum_{l,m} \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_o(2l+1)}\left(r^l-\frac{a^{2l+1}}{r^{l+1}}\right)\frac{1}{r'^{l+1}}Y^*_{lm}(\theta',\phi')Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)$$

$$\Phi^o(r,\theta,\phi)=\sum_{l,m} \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_o(2l+1)r'^{l+1}}\frac{r'^{2l+1}-a^{2l+1}}{r^{l+1}}Y^*_{lm}(\theta',\phi')Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)$$

$\Phi^o$ can be written in a form that reveals the fact that $\Phi^o(r,r')=\Phi^i(r',r)$

$$\Phi^o(r,\theta,\phi)=\sum_{l,m} \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_o(2l+1)}\left(r'^{l}-\frac{a^{2l+1}}{r'^{l+1}}\right)\frac{1}{r^{l+1}}Y^*_{lm}(\theta',\phi')Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)$$

The equations have the symmetry of a Dirichlet Green function and the radial term also matches Equation 3.115 of Jackson (which follows trivially from 3.114). The scaling factor between $\Phi$ and $G$ is found by noting that

$$\nabla^2G=-4\pi\delta(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}')$$

using the spherical representation of $\delta(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}')$ is

$$\nabla^2G=-4\pi\frac{\delta(r-r')}{r'^2}\delta(\cos\theta-\cos\theta')\delta(\phi-\phi')$$

We solved

$$\nabla^2\Phi=-\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_o}$$

with, to start,

$$\rho=\frac{q}{4\pi r'^2}\delta(r-r')=\sigma'\delta(r-r')$$

Then $\sigma'$ was replaced with $q\delta(\cos\theta-\cos\theta')\delta(\phi-\phi')/4\pi r'^2$ giving

$$\rho=q\frac{\delta(r-r')}{4\pi r'^2}\delta(\cos\theta-\cos\theta')\delta(\phi-\phi')$$

and so the Poisson equation that we solved

$$\nabla^2\Phi=-\frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\frac{\delta(r-r')}{ r'^2}\delta(\cos\theta-\cos\theta')\delta(\phi-\phi')$$

Comparing the equations for and $\nabla^2G$ and $\nabla^2\Phi$ gives

$$\frac{G}{4\pi} = \frac{4\pi\epsilon_o}{q} \Phi$$

Using this gives the Green function associated with $\Phi$:

$$G(r,\theta,\phi)=4\pi\sum_{l,m} \frac{1}{2l+1}\left(r^l-\frac{a^{2l+1}}{r^{l+1}}\right)\frac{1}{r'^{l+1}}Y^*_{lm}(\theta',\phi')Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)\qquad r\lt r'$$

$$G(r,\theta,\phi)=4\pi\sum_{l,m} \frac{1}{2l+1}\left(r'^{l}-\frac{a^{2l+1}}{r'^{l+1}}\right)\frac{1}{r^{l+1}}Y^*_{lm}(\theta',\phi')Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)\qquad r\gt r'$$

Which can be rearranged to the form of equation 3.114 of Jackson.

$$G(r,\theta,\phi)=4\pi\sum_{l,m} \frac{1}{2l+1}\left[\frac{r^l}{r'^{l+1}}-\frac{1}{a}\left(\frac{a^2}{rr'}\right)^{l+1}\right]Y^*_{lm}(\theta',\phi')Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)\qquad r\lt r'$$

$$G(r,\theta,\phi)=4\pi\sum_{l,m} \frac{1}{2l+1}\left[\frac{r'^l}{r^{l+1}}-\frac{1}{a}\left(\frac{a^2}{rr'}\right)^{l+1}\right]Y^*_{lm}(\theta',\phi')Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)\qquad r\gt r'$$

3.

Key steps given only for now. See previous problems with similar steps for justifications.

$$G = G_{r\lt r'}\Theta(r'-r) + G_{r\gt r'}\Theta(r-r')$$

$$\frac{\partial G}{\partial n'} = -\frac{\partial G}{\partial r'}=-\frac{\partial G_{r\lt r'}}{\partial r'}\Theta(r'-r)-\frac{\partial G_{r\gt r'}}{\partial r'}\Theta(r-r')$$

Keep first term because $r'=a$ means $r\ge a$.

$$\frac{\partial G}{\partial n'}=-\frac{\partial G_{r\gt r'}}{\partial r'}=-4\pi\sum_{l,m} \frac{1}{2l+1}\frac{\partial}{\partial r'}\left[\frac{r'^l}{r^{l+1}}-\frac{1}{a}\left(\frac{a^2}{rr'}\right)^{l+1}\right]Y^*_{lm}(\theta',\phi')Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)$$

$$\frac{\partial G}{\partial n'}=-4\pi\sum_{l,m} \frac{1}{2l+1}\left[\frac{lr'^{l-1}}{r^{l+1}}+(l+1)\frac{1}{a}\left(\frac{a^2}{rr'^2}\right)^{l+1}\right]Y^*_{lm}(\theta',\phi')Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)$$

$$\frac{\partial G}{\partial n'}\Bigg|_{r'=a}=-4\pi\sum_{l,m} \frac{1}{2l+1}\left[\frac{la^{l-1}}{r^{l+1}}+(l+1)\frac{1}{a}\left(\frac{a^2}{ra^2}\right)^{l+1}\right]Y^*_{lm}(\theta',\phi')Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)$$

$$\frac{\partial G}{\partial n'}\Bigg|_{r'=a}=-4\pi\sum_{l,m} \frac{a^{l-1}}{r^{l+1}}Y^*_{lm}(\theta',\phi')Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)$$

$$\Psi(\mathbf{x})=-\frac{1}{4\pi}\oint_{\mathcal{S}} \Psi(\mathbf{x}')\frac{\partial G}{\partial n'}\Bigg|_{r'=a}da'$$

$G$ is proportional to potential and the surface charge density on the conductors is proportional to $\partial \Psi/\partial r$ at $r=a$; this equations is equivalent to computing the potential due to the charges on the conductor.

$$\Psi(\mathbf{x})=-\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi}\Psi(a)\frac{\partial G}{\partial n'}\Bigg|_{r'=a}a^2\sin\thet\thinspace d\theta'd\phi'$$

$$\Psi(\mathbf{x})=-\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}d\phi'\left[\int_{0}^{\pi/2}V_o\frac{\partial G}{\partial n'}\Bigg|_{r'=a}\sin\thet\thinspace d\theta'-\int_{\pi/2}^{\pi}V_o\frac{\partial G}{\partial n'}\Bigg|_{r'=a}\sin\thet\thinspace d\theta'\right]$$

$$\Psi(\mathbf{x})=V_o\sum_{l,m} \left(\frac{a}{r}\right)^{l+1}Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)\int_0^{2\pi}d\phi'\left[\int_{0}^{\pi/2}Y^*_{lm}(\theta',\phi')\sin\thet\thinspace d\theta'-\int_{\pi/2}^{\pi}Y^*_{lm}(\theta',\phi')\sin\thet\thinspace d\theta'\right]$$

$$\Psi(\mathbf{x})=V_o\sum_{l,m}\left(\frac{a}{r}\right)^{l+1}f(l)e^{im\phi}P_{lm}(\theta,\phi)\int_0^{2\pi}d\phi'\left[\int_{0}^{\pi/2}f(l)e^{-im\phi'}P^l_{m}\sin\thet\thinspace d\theta'-\int_{\pi/2}^{\pi}e^{-im\phi'}P^l_{m}\sin\thet\thinspace d\theta'\right]$$

Eqn. 3.53

$$Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)= f(l)P^l_m(\cos\theta)e^{im\phi}$$

$$f(l) = \sqrt{\frac{2l+1}{4\pi}\frac{(l-m)!}{(l+m)!}}$$

$$\Psi(\mathbf{x})=V_o\sum_{l,m}\left(\frac{a}{r}\right)^{l+1}e^{im\phi}P_{l}^m(\theta,\phi)I_{lm}$$

$$I_{lm} \equiv [f(l)]^2\int_0^{2\pi}d\phi'\left[\int_{0}^{\pi/2}f(l)e^{-im\phi'}P_l^{m}(\cos\theta')\sin\thet\thinspace d\theta'-\int_{\pi/2}^{\pi}e^{-im\phi'}P^m_{l}(\cos\theta')\sin\thet\thinspace d\theta'\right]$$

$$I_{lm} =  [f(l)]^2\int_0^{2\pi}e^{-im\phi'}d\phi'\left[\int_{0}^{\pi/2}P_l^{m}(\cos\theta')-\int_{\pi/2}^{\pi}P_l^{m}(\cos\theta')\right]\sin\thet\thinspace d\theta'$$

$$I_{lm} =  [f(l)]^2\int_0^{2\pi}e^{-im\phi'}d\phi'\left[\int_{0}^{1}P^m_{l}(x)dx-\int_{-1}^{0}P^m_{l}(x)dx\right]$$

$I_{lm}=0$ for $m\ne 0$.

$$I_{l} = \frac{(2l+1)}{2}\left[\int_{0}^{1}P_{l}(x)dx-\int_{-1}^{0}P_{l}(x)dx\right]$$

$I_l=A_l$ with $A_l$ given by eqn. 3.26; $A_0=0$, $A_1=3/2$, $A_2=0$, $A_3=-7/8$, ...

$$\Psi(r,\theta)=V_o\sum_{l=1,3,...} \frac{a^{l+1}}{r^{l+1}}P_{l}(\theta)A_{l}$$

$$\Psi(r,\theta)\simeq V_o\left[\frac{3}{2}\left(\frac{a}{r}\right)^2P_1(\cos\theta)-\frac{7}{8}\left(\frac{r}{a}\right)^4P_3(\cos\theta)+\frac{11}{16}\left(\frac{r}{a}\right)^6P_5(\cos\theta)\right]$$

Same as eqn. 3.36 with replacement of $(r/a)^l$ with $(a/r)^{l+1}$.  Far away, the system looks like a dipole (due to opposite-sign charge density on each hemisphere), so we expect only odd $l$ terms, as found.

## Long Dielectric Cylinder 

An infinitely long dielectric cylinder of radius $b$ is placed into a vacuum region of space with an initially uniform electric field $E_o\hat{\mathbf{x}}$. The cylinder is parallel to and centered on the $z-$axis.

The cylinder has a dielectric constant of $\epsilon$. Find the potential inside and outside of the dielectric.

In class, I mentioned that one could "guess" which terms in the general solution to $\nabla^2\psi(s,\phi)=0$ of

$$
\begin{align}
\psi(s,\phi)  = {} &  A_o+a_o\ln s\\
& +\sum_{n=1}^\infty (A_n\cos n\phi+B_n\sin n\phi)s^n\\
& +\sum_{n=1}^\infty (a_n\cos n\phi+b_n\sin n\phi)s^{-n}
\end{align}
$$

to keep and start the solution at that point. For this problem, start with the general solution and provide justification for constants that are zero. In the equations above, $s$ is the radial cylindrical coordinate and $\phi$ is the cylindrical angular coordinate.

Most students were able to get the correct answer, which is not surprising because this is a problem from Griffiths for which solutions can be found easily. The reason that I asked for justifications was to make sure that you understood the solutions that you were reading and/or could spot errors or poor logic. This was an opportunity to clarify your logic in solving these types of problems. Unfortunately, many students still used specious logic found on a Google search of "dielectric cylinder in a uniform electric field".

This is a problem with the logic of "the potential does not blow up" at infinity fails. The potential does "blow up" because it has a term proportional to $s$.

A common comment was that the condition $\epsilon/\epsilon_o=-1$ implied a set of coefficients were zero because $\epsilon$ had to be greater than zero. I wondered why this statement was made so frequently in student answers and I found a similar statement [https://physicspages.com/pdf/Griffiths%20EM/Griffiths%20Problems%2004.22.pdf here]. I accepted this because technically it is a valid statement, but there is a more general reason that applies. (One could be given a non-physical problem in which $\epsilon$ was negative and the set of coefficients would still be zero.) This is discussed in my solution.

In the following, I give two solutions to this problem. The first is the type of solution that I was looking for. The second is a brief solution that uses some intuition that is gained from solving these types of problems to make large steps with the only mathematical justification being that the guesses gave a solution that satisfied the boundary conditions and Laplace's equation and therefore it is the solution as a result of the uniqueness of solutions to Laplace's equation. You should be able to do these types of problems in both ways. Quite often on more complex problems, you can't rely on shortcuts of the type taken here and you need a solid understanding of the mathematical justifications for each step.

----

'''First Solution'''

To be posted.

----

'''Second Solution'''

For large $s$, we expect $\psi\rightarrow V_o - E_os\cos\theta$. Because there is a cosine term for large $s$, we expect a cosine term in the outer and inner solution (based on experience with the analogous sphere-in-a-dielectric problem). So we make an attempt for a solution using the following forms for the potential.

$$\psi_o=V_o+\frac{B_1}{s}\cos\phi-E_os\cos\phi$$

$$\psi_i=A_o+A_1s\cos\phi$$

The boundary condition

$\psi_o(s)=\psi_i(s)$

gives

$$A_o=V_o\quad \text{and}\quad A_1=B_1/a^2-E_o$$

The boundary condition

$$D_{os}-D_{is}=0$$

corresponds to

$$-\epsilon_o\frac{\partial \psi_o}{\partial s}+\epsilon\frac{\partial \psi_i}{\partial s} = 0$$

and this gives

$$B_1=-s_o^2E_o-\epsilon_rA_1s_o^2$$

which when combined with $A_1=B_1/a^2-E_o$ gives

$$B_1=\frac{1-\epsilon_r}{1+\epsilon_r}E_os_o^2$$

and

$$A_1=-\frac{2E_o}{\epsilon_r+1}$$

So the potentials are

$$\psi_o=V_o+E_o\frac{\epsilon_r-1}{\epsilon_r+1}\frac{s_o^2}{s}\cos\phi-E_os\cos\phi$$

$$\psi_i=V_o-\frac{2E_o}{\epsilon_r+1}s\cos\phi$$

Note when $\epsilon_r\rightarrow \infty$, is consistent with the solution for a conducting cylinder. For $s_o\rightarrow 0$ the solution is consistent with the solution for a line of charge with $\lambda=0$ (because all of the polarized charges are on top of each other) in an electric field $E_o\hat{\mathbf{x}}$: the inner potential, which corresponds to $\psi_i(0,\theta)$ in this limit) is $V_o$ and the outer potential is the external potential. The dielectric does not contribute to the electric field because the bound charges are on top of each other at the origin.

## Dipole in a Dielectric 

A perfect dipole $\mathbf{p}=p_o\hat{\mathbf{z}}$ at the origin is at the center of a dielectric sphere of radius $b$ that is centered on the origin. The dielectric constant of the sphere is $\epsilon$.

Find the potential inside and outside of the dielectric using the boundary value method. (You do not need to start with the full general solution for this problem - you may "guess" which terms from the full general solution will be non-zero and start your solution from there.)

Most students were able to get the following answers. Many students used the argument that the potential should be of the form

$$\psi = \psi_d + \sum_{l=0}^{\infty}A_lr^lP_l(\cos\theta)$$

where $\psi_d$ is the formula for a dipole in a dielectric. This is somewhat different than the approach I've seen in class and on homework. I was expecting to see

$$\psi = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty}A_lr^l+\frac{B_l}{r^{l+1}}P_l(\cos\theta)$$

and the argument $\psi(r\rightarrow 0,\theta)\rightarrow \psi_d = p_o\cos\theta/4\pi\epsilon r^2$, from which one would conclude that $B_1=p_o/4\pi\epsilon$ and $B_l=0$ otherwise. If you are using someone else's solution, it is always a good idea to do things more in the way that you are familiar with or in a different way to ensure that you are not just copying someone's answer and that you learn something from this. (I usually avoid giving problems where solutions are easily found using an internet search. I guess this one is easily found.)

1.

$$\psi(r,\theta)=\frac{p_o\cos\theta}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\frac{1}{r^2}$$

2.

$$\psi_i=\frac{p_o\cos\theta}{4\pi\epsilon}\left(\frac{1}{r^2}+2\frac{\epsilon_r-1}{1+2\epsilon_r}\frac{r}{b^3}\right)$$

$$\psi_o=\frac{p_o\cos\theta}{4\pi\epsilon}\frac{3}{1+2\epsilon_r}\frac{1}{r^2}$$

where $\epsilon_r=\epsilon/\epsilon_o$

1. Before 9 pm on April 28th, either (1) ask a substantial question on Piazza on a topic covered in 5.8-5.10 of Jackson or (2) answer a question on Piazza. I don't know how to define a "substantial" question beyond saying that your question should be specific and followed by comments on what you did in an attempt to answer the question yourself and a bit of introductory material. An example of a good question has been posted to Piazza. If you want to use equations, copy them from the course web page and modify them as needed. To see the LaTeX, use "Tools-View Source" on the left-hand-side menu on the course web page. In Piazza, all equations are surrounded by double dollar signs, e.g., <code>$$\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{B}=0$$</code>. Some of the equations on the course web page are surrounded by <code>$</code> and <code>$</code>, e.g., <code>$\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{B}=0$</code>; these need to be replaced with the double dollar sign.

## Amperes' Law 

A surface current flows uniformly on the surface of a long cylinder.

In general, in cylindrical coordinates, the magnetic field has the form

$$\mathbf{B}=B_s(s,\phi,z)\hat{\mathbf{s}}+B_{\phi}(s,\phi,z)\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}+B_z(s,\phi,z)\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

To use Amperes' law, arguments are made that the field must have the form

$$\mathbf{B}=B_{\phi}(s)\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$$

Provide a justification for the arguments needed to claim

1. $B_s(s,\phi,z)=0$
1. $B_z(s,\phi,z)=0$
1. $B_{\phi}$ does not depend on $\phi$ and $z$

Recall that Amperes' law generally only gives information about one component of the field (when there is enough symmetry to do so). Other physical arguments are needed to determine all components of the field and why Amperes' law can be used to find one component of the field.

There are two steps required to answer this question:

1. The field due to infinitely long wire along the $z$-axis is in the $\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$ direction.
1. The field due to wires placed uniformly along the surface of a cylinder to form a surface current $K_o$ is in the $\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$ direction.

To show 1., consider a differential element of wire on the $z$-axis at an arbitrary position $z'$.

$$\mathbf{B}_{dI}=\frac{\mu_o I}{4\pi}\frac{d\mathbf{l}\times\hat{\bf{\char"0509}}}{\char"0509^2}$$

where

$$\mathbf{\char"0509}=s\hat{\mathbf{s}}-z'\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

and

$$d\mathbf{l}=dz'\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

The cross product $$d\mathbf{l}\times\hat{\bf{\char"0509}}$$ is in the direction $\hat{\mathbf{z}}\times\hat{\mathbf{s}}=\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$. So all differential elements of current on the wire create a $\mathbf{B}$ in the $\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$ direction.

Therefore, the magnetic field due to an infinite wire is always tangent to a circle centered on the wire and in a plane perpendicular to the wire.

To show 2., consider the magnetic field at a point of interest in the $x$-$y$ plane on the $s$ axis created by the wires placed along the surface at equal distances above and below the $s$ axis as shown in the diagram. The current at $U$ and $L$ flows out of the page. Each wire creates a field that is tangent to a circle centered on the wire and with a direction determined by the right-hand rule. The field for the upper and lower wires is not each in the $\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$ in this coordinate system. The $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ components of the fields cancel, leaving only a component in the $\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$ direction. So every wire on the top half of the circle shown has a wire on the bottom half with a canceling $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$-component and so the field must be in the $\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$ direction.

This explains why $B_s=B_z=0$. $B_{\phi}$ does not depend on $\phi$ because the diagram is the same for any $\phi$ (the $x$-axis could be drawn in any direction on this diagram, and the angle $\phi$ is the angle between the $x$-axis and the $\mathbf{s}$ axis). $B_{\phi}$ does not depend on $z$ because the diagram is not changed if the plane shown in the figure was shifted in the $z$ direction.

## Force on Current Loop 

The current loop of radius $b$ shown in the figure is in the $z=d$ plane carries a current $I$.

There is an external magnetic field of 

$$\mathbf{B}_{ext}=\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\frac{m_o}{r^3}\left(2\cos\theta\hat{\mathbf{r}}+\sin\theta\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\right)$$

that is due to a magnetic dipole at the origin.

There were several common errors. 
1. Some reported a force that depended on $r$ and $\theta$ either explicity or implicitly because their unit vectors appeared in their answer. It does not make sense for the force on an object to depend on a coordinate. It should depend on the parameters given in the problem. In addition, the force depended on a coordinate, we would write $\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x})=\int \mathbf{J}\times \mathbf{B}d^3x'$, which we don't - see the previous problem.
1. When computing the gradient of a function that involved $r$, $r$ was treated as a constant. More on this in the solution.
1. The wrong delta function representation of $\mathbf{J}$. You know that you need to get $\int \mathbf{I}\times \mathbf{B} dl$ after evaluating the delta function in the volume integral given, so this could have been used as a check that you had the correct delta function representation of $\mathbf{J}$.

1.

$$\mathbf{F}=\int \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x})\times \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x\thinspace d^3x$$

Many students had questions about representing $\mathbf{J}$ with a delta function. As a guide, recall that you know the result after application of the delta function in $\mathbf{J}$ should be

$$\mathbf{F}=\int \mathbf{I}\times \mathbf{\thinspace dl$$

where $\mathbf{B}$ is evaluated at the locations of the differential elements $dl$, and $dl\thinspace d\phi$ for this problem. It is easier to do this in cylindrical coordinates, but most attempted modifying Jackson's equation for a current loop of radius $a$ in the $x$-$y$ plane and centered on the origin:

$$J_{\phi}=I\sin\theta\thinspace\delta(\cos\theta)\frac{\delta (r-a)}{a}$$

where

$$\mathbf{J}=J_{\phi}(-\sin\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{x}}+\cos\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{y}})$$

By delta function identity #5 on page 26, $J_{\phi}$ above is equivalent to 

$$J_{\phi}=I\delta(\theta-\pi/2)\frac{\delta (r-a)}{a}$$

You can (correctly) guess and that show that for this problem, replacing $\pi/2$ with $\theta_o$ and $a$ with $r_o$,  where $\tan\theta_o=b/d$ and $r_o=\sqrt{d^2+b^2}$ will result the volume integral reducing to the line interal.

Several students asked how to derive Jackson's equation or the guessed modified equation, so I'll derive it here. A student also mentioned that they found [https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/128732/describing-a-circular-current-loop-as-delta-functions], but it didn't quite help. We need to find

$$\mathbf{J} = J(r,\theta)(-\sin\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{x}}+\cos\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{y}})$$

where $J(r,\theta)$ has the property that it is zero except for $(r,\theta)$ on the loop. $\delta(r-r_o)$ is zero except on the surface of a sphere of radius $r_o$ and $\delta(\theta-\theta_o)$ is zero except on the surface of a cone with apex angle $\theta_o$. The product of these two delta functions (corresponding to the intersection of these two surfaces) is non-zero only at positions on the loop. As in charge distribution problems, we need to find a constant $C$ in

$$J(r,\theta)=C\delta(r-r_o)\delta(\theta-\theta_o)$$

where $\tan\theta_o=b/d$ and $r_o=\sqrt{d^2+b^2}$. To determine $C$, note that integrating $J$ over all space is equivalent to multiplying the current by the length of the wire it flows through.

$$2\pi b I = \int J(\mathbf{x\thinspace d^3x=C\int \delta(r-r_o)\delta(\theta-\theta_o)\sin\theta_o\thinspacer\thinspace dc\thinspace d\the\thinspace d\phi$$

$$2\pi b I = C2\pi\sin\theta_o r_o^2\Rightarrow C = \frac{bI}{r_o^2\sin\theta_o }$$

$$J(r,\theta)=\frac{I b}{\sin\theta_o r_o^2}\delta(r-r_o)\delta(\theta-\theta_o)=\frac{I}{r_o}\delta(r-r_o)\delta(\theta-\theta_o)$$

When $\theta_o=\pi/2$, $r_o=b$ we recover Jackson's equation.

$$
\begin{align}
\mathbf{F} & = \int \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x})\times \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x\thinspace d^3x\\
& = \int  J(r,\theta)(-\sin\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{x}}+\cos\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{y}})\times \mathbf{B}(r,\theta)\thinspacer^2\sin\the\thinspace d\the\thinspace d\phi\\
& = \int  \frac{I}{r_o}\delta(r-r_o)\delta(\theta-\theta_o)(-\sin\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{x}}+\cos\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{y}})\times \mathbf{B}(r,\theta)\thinspacer^2\sin\the\thinspace d\the\thinspace d\phi\\
& = \int I (-\sin\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{x}}+\cos\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{y}})\times \mathbf{B}(r_o,\theta_o)\thinspacer_o\sin\theta\thinspace d\phi\\
& = \int I (-\sin\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{x}}+\cos\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{y}})\times \mathbf{B}(r_o,\theta_o)\thinspac\thinspace d\phi\\
& = \int I (-\sin\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{x}}+\cos\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{y}})\times \mathbf{B}(r_o,\theta_\thinspace dl
\end{align}
$$

This last equation is how I checked that I had the correct delta function. If I had used $\mathbf{F}=\int \mathbf{I}\times \mathbf{\thinspace dl$, this would be the result.

$$
\begin{align}
(-\sin\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{x}}+\cos\phi\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{y}})\times \mathbf{B}(r_o,\theta_o) & =\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}\times \frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\frac{m_o}{r^3}\left(2\cos\theta\hat{\mathbf{r}}+\sin\theta\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\right)\\
& = \frac{\mu_oI}{4\pi}\frac{m_o}{r^3}(2\cos\theta\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}\times\hat{\mathbf{r}}+\sin\theta\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}\times\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}})\\
& = \frac{\mu_oI}{4\pi}\frac{m_o}{r^3}(2\cos\theta\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}-\sin\theta\hat{\mathbf{r}})\end{align}
$$

Prior to integration, non-cartesian vectors must be converted to cartesian. Use the spherical-to-cartesian transformation matrix

$$\begin{bmatrix}{\hat{\boldsymbol{r}}} \\ {\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta }}} \\ {\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi }}}\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}\sin \theta\cos \phi & \sin\theta \sin\phi & \cos\theta \\ \cos\theta \cos\phi & \cos\theta \sin\phi & -\sin\theta \\ -\sin\phi & \cos\phi & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}{\hat{\mathbf{x}}} \\ {\hat{\mathbf{y}}} \\{\hat{\mathbf{z}}}\end{bmatrix}$$

to write the spherical unit vectors $\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ using cartesian unit vectors and then integrate with respect to $d\phi$. The result is

$$\mathbf{F}=-\frac{3}{2}\frac{\mu_om_oIdb^2}{(b^2+d^2)^{5/2}}\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

One can get equivalent results by converting $\mathbf{B}_{ext}$ into cartesian using the above matrix and doing the cross product with $\mathbf{J}$ written with cartesian unit vectors. The components of $B_{ext}$ in cartesian coordinates, with $r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$, are

$$B_x=\frac{\mu_oI\pi a^2}{4\pi}\frac{3xz}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{5/2}}=\frac{\mu_oI\pi a^2}{4\pi}\frac{3xz}{r^5}$$

$$B_y=\frac{\mu_oI\pi a^2}{4\pi}\frac{3yz}{r^5}$$

$$B_z=\frac{\mu_oI\pi a^2}{4\pi}\frac{3z^2-r^2}{r^5}$$

Compute the horizontal, $B_s$, and vertical, $B_z$, magnetic field at all points on the loop. Then compute the horizontal and vertical forces created by these two fields individually. $B_s$ results in a vertical force on a differential element $dl$ of $-IdlB_s\hat{\mathbf{z}}$. $B_z$ results in a horizontal force of $IdlB_z\hat{\mathbf{s}}$.  The horizontal force averages to zero. The total vertical force is obtained by using $dl=bd\phi$ and integrating

$$\int_0^{2\pi}-IB_sbd\phi\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

The magnitude of horizontal field is $B_s=\sqrt{B_x^2+B_y^2}$ and $B_x$ and $B_y$ were found in a previous problem. Neither depend on $\phi$. The result is

$$B_s(x,y)=\sqrt{B_x^2+B_y^2}=\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\frac{3m_oz}{r^5}\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$$

On the loop, $z=d$, $x^2+y^2=b^2$, and $r^2=b^2+d^2$. Putting this all together gives a net force of

$$\mathbf{F}=-\frac{3}{2}\frac{\mu_om_oIdb^2}{(b^2+d^2)^{5/2}}\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

2.

The primed notation is usually used for the dummy integration variable when the result after integration is a function of $\mathbf{x}$. Here the result after integration does not depend on position because we are computing the force on a current loop.

I accepted any answer to this question. I asked this because the lack of primes is something you should have noticed and asked yourself why primes are used in some integrals and not in others.

3.

$$\mathbf{m}=Ib^2\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

$$\mathbf{m}\cdot\mathbf{B}=Ib^2B_z$$

From the note in the solution to 1.,

$$B_z=\frac{\mu_oI\pi a^2}{4\pi}\frac{3z^2-r^2}{r^5}$$

The formula 

$$\mathbf{F}=\boldsymbol{\nabla}(\mathbf{m}\cdot\mathbf{B})$$

was derived by expanding $\mathbf{B}$ about around a point near a current loop and under the assumption that the change in $\mathbf{B}$ was small over the area of the loop and so the result must be evaluated at a point near the current loop, for which I use $(x,y,z)=(0,0,d)$. (Jackson says $\mathbf{B}$ is expanded about a "suitable origin" but does not elaborate on what constitutes suitableness. By default, it makes the most sense to expand about the center of the current distribution, but if the field changes more rapidly on one part of the current distribution, one may get a more accurate answer if the expansion is performed where the field changes the most. However, if the answer strongly depends on the origin, probably this approximate formula should not be used.)

$$\mathbf{F}=\left[\hat{\mathbf{x}}\frac{\partial B_z}{\partial x}+\hat{\mathbf{y}}\frac{\partial B_z}{\partial y}+\hat{\mathbf{z}}\frac{\partial B_z}{\partial z}\right]_{(x,y,z)=(0,0,d)}$$

The result is

$$\mathbf{F}=-\frac{3}{2}\frac{\mu_om_oIb^2}{d^4}\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

If interested, try evaluating the gradient of $B_z$ about a different location, say $0,b,z_o$ - you should get the same result to first order in a $b/d$  expansion. However, there will be a net force in the $y$-direction, which does not match the exact result. Therefore this choice of origin seems not "suitable". But to know it was not suitable, we had to know the exact result! As a result, I would argue that the approximate formula for an arbitrary current distribution is mostly useful for interpretation rather than calculation - $\mathbf{F}=\boldsymbol{\nabla}(\mathbf{m}\cdot\mathbf{B})$ means a gradient in its argument will result in a force.

The most common error students made was setting $r=b^2+d^2$ in

$$B_z=\frac{\mu_oI\pi a^2}{4\pi}\frac{3z^2-r^2}{r^5}$$

and not setting $z=d$. This is inconsistent because in setting $r=b^2+d^2$, $z$ was replaced with $d$. If $z$ was also replaced with $d$, $B_z$ would be constant and the computed force would be zero.

The force equation we are dealing with is based on the gradient of $\mathbf{B}$ and setting all variables to values, or worse, only some variables to values, in $\mathbf{B}$ will lead to an incorrect answer. One needs to substitute values for the variables after the derivatives are computed. (Think of finding the slope of $y=x^2$ at x=2. You don't first set $x=2$, giving $y=4$ and $dy/dx = 0$).

4.

The result from 1. was

$$\mathbf{F}=-\frac{3}{2}\frac{\mu_om_oIdb^2}{(b^2+d^2)^{5/2}}\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

or, after factoring out a $d^5$ in the denominator,

$$\mathbf{F}=-\frac{3}{2}\frac{\mu_om_oIb^2}{d^4\left(1+\left(\frac{b}{d}\right)^2\right)^{5/2}}\hat{\mathbf{z}}\simeq -\frac{3}{2}\frac{\mu_om_oIb^2}{d^4}\hat{\mathbf{z}}\left(1-\frac{5}{2}\frac{b^2}{d^2}\right)$$

which matches the result from 3. in the limit that $b/d\rightarrow 0$, as expected because the relevant length scales that determine how much $\mathbf{B}$ changes over the loop are the distance of the loop from the dipole to the length scale of the loop.

## Sphere with uniform $\mathbf{M}$ 

In Griffiths, 4rd edition, direct integration is used to find $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ for a uniformly magnetized sphere: $\mathbf{M}=M_o\hat{\mathbf{z}}$. The approach is to compute $\mathbf{J}_b$ and $\mathbf{K}_b$ using

$$\mathbf{J}_b=\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{M}$$

and

$$\mathbf{K}_b=\mathbf{M}\times\hat{\mathbf{n}}$$

Because $\mathbf{J}_b=0$, he starts with

$$\mathbf{A}=\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\int\frac{\mathbf{K}_b}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}da'$$

and integrates to compute $\mathbf{A}$ and then the relationship $\mathbf{B}=\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\mathbf{A}$ is used to find $\mathbf{B}$. 

Chapter 5.10 of Jacksons contains a related solution.

In this problem, the boundary value method will be used. 

Recall that the Maxwell macroscopic equations for the magnetic field are 

$$\boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{B}=0\quad\text{and}\quad \boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\mathbf{H}=\mathbf{J}_f$$

where $\mathbf{J}_f$ is the free current. Using the defining relationship for $\mathbf{H}$, $\mathbf{B}=\mu_o(\mathbf{H}+\mathbf{M})$, and $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{B}=0$, these equations can be written as

$$\boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{H}=-\boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}\quad\text{and}\quad \boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\mathbf{H}=\mathbf{J}_f$$

When $\mathbf{J}_f=0$, $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\mathbf{H}=0$ and thus one can write $\mathbf{H}$ as the gradient of a scalar function that will be called $\psi_m$: $\mathbf{H}=-\boldsymbol{\nabla}\psi_m$ and so

$$\nabla^2\psi_m=\boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}$$

For a uniformly magnetized sphere, $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}=0$ except at the surface of the sphere. The problem has azimuthal symmetry, so we can write $\psi_m=\psi_m(r,\theta)$ using the general solution to Laplace's equation for a problem with azimuthal symmetry:

$$\psi_m(r,\theta)=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\left(A_lr^l + B_lr^{-l-1}\right)P_l(\cos\theta)$$

This equation applies both inside and outside of the sphere (but not at the surface of the sphere).

Using one or more of the boundary conditions

1. $\psi_m$ finite for $r=0$
1. $\psi_m\rightarrow 0$ as $r\rightarrow\infty$
1. $\psi_m$ is continuous
1. $(\mathbf{B}_2-\mathbf{B_1})\boldsymbol{\cdot}\hat{\mathbf{n}}=0$

find $\mathbf{B}$ and then $\mathbf{A}$.

To solve this using the boundary value method, start with

$$\psi(r,\theta)=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\left(A_lr^l + B_lr^{-l-1}\right)P_l(\cos\theta)$$

BC 1. gives $B_l=0$ for the inner potential, $\psi_i$. BC 2. gives $A_l=0$ for the outer potential, $\psi_o$. The potentials thus simplify to

$$\psi_i=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}A_lr^lP_l(\cos\theta)$$

$$\psi_o=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\frac{B_l}{r^{l+1}}P_l(\cos\theta)$$

BC 3. gives

$$B_l=A_la^{2l+1}$$

BC 4. can be re-written as

$$\frac{\partial \psi_o}{\partial r}\Biggm\lvert_{r=a}=\frac{\partial \psi_i}{\partial r}\Biggm\lvert_{r=a}-\thinspaceM_o\cos\theta$$

From this,

$$A_1=M_o-\frac{2B_1}{a^3}$$

and

$$A_l=-aB_l\frac{l+1}{l}\quad l\ne 1$$

When these are combined with $B_l=A_la^{2l+1}$, the result is

$$B_1=A_1a^3$$

and

$$B_l=A_l=0\quad l\ne 1$$

Finally,

$$\psi_i=\frac{M_o}{3}r\cos\theta\qquad\qquad \psi_o=\frac{M_o}{3}\frac{a^3}{r^2}\cos\theta$$

The gradient in spherical coordinates is

$$\boldsymbol{\nabla}=\hat{\mathbf{r}}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}+\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}$$

and so $\mathbf{H}=-\boldsymbol{\nabla}\psi$ gives

$$\mathbf{H}_i=\frac{M_o}{3}\left(-\cos\theta\hat{\mathbf{r}}+\sin\theta\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\right)=-\frac{M_o}{3}\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

and

$$\mathbf{H}_o=\frac{M_o}{3}\frac{a^3}{r^3}\left(2\cos\theta\hat{\mathbf{r}}+\sin\theta\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\right)$$

Using $\mathbf{B}=\mu_o(\mathbf{H}+\mathbf{M})$ gives

$$\mathbf{B}_i=\mu_o(\mathbf{H}_i+M_o\hat{\mathbf{z}})=\frac{2}{3}\mu_oM_o\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

and

$$\mathbf{B}_o=\mu_oH_o=\mu_o\frac{M_o}{3}\frac{a^3}{r^3}\left(2\cos\theta\hat{\mathbf{r}}+\sin\theta\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\right)$$

To compute $\mathbf{A}$, one could use the method given in Jackson section 5.10. Alternatively, $\mathbf{A}$ can be arrived at by analogy. Outside, $\mathbf{B}$ has the form of of a magnetic dipole at the origin with a dipole moment of $\mathbf{m} = \hat{\mathbf{z}}4\pi a^3M_o/3$. Using this with the magnetic dipole equation $(\mu_o/4\pi)\thinspace{\mathbf{m}\times \mathbf{r}}/{r^3}$,

$$\mathbf{A}_o=\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\frac{\mathbf{m}\times \mathbf{r}}{r^3}=\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\frac{4\pi a^3M_o}{3}\frac{\hat{\mathbf{z}}\times \hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}=\mu_o\frac{M_oa^3}{3}\frac{\sin\theta}{r^2}\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$$

Inside, the magnetic field is uniform, which is the case for an infinitely long solenoid, so

$$\mathbf{A}_i=\frac{B_i}{2}s\thinspace\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$$

where $s$ is the cylindrical radius, which in spherical coordinates is $s=r\sin\theta$ so that 

$$\mathbf{A}_i=\mu_o\frac{M_o}{3}r\sin\theta\thinspace\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$$

'''Alternative solution method 1'''

To check your answers, note that the solution for $\mathbf{A}$ using direct integration is given as example and example in Jackson section 5.10 and Griffiths 6.1 and 5.11. (Note the differences in approach to the integration between Jackson and Griffiths).  From this, one can compute $\mathbf{B}=\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{A}$ and then use  $\mathbf{B}=\mu_o(\mathbf{H}+\mathbf{M})$ and $\mathbf{H}=-\nabla\psi_m$ to compute $\psi_m$. 

'''Alternative solution method for $\psi$'''

With the direct integration method, one needs to evaluate

$$\psi_m=\frac{1}{4\pi}\oint_S\frac{\hat{\mathbf{n}}'\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}da'$$

(see Jackson equation 5.100).  With $\hat{\mathbf{n}}'=\hat{\mathbf{r}}'$ and $\mathbf{M}=M_o\hat{\mathbf{z}}$, the numerator is

$$\hat{\mathbf{n}}'\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}=M_o\hat{\mathbf{r}}'\boldsymbol{\cdot}\hat{\mathbf{z}}= M_o\cos\theta'$$

and the integral is identical to that for a uniformly polarized sphere or a sphere with a surface charge that varies as $\cos\theta$; both problems are typically given as textbook examples and their solutions can be used to quickly write down the answer. 

'''Alternative solution method for $\mathbf{A}$'''

An alternative approach to computing $\mathbf{A}$ outside is to use the same approach typically used to compute $\mathbf{A}$ inside an infinitely long solenoid. First, note that the magnetic flux through a surface $\mathcal{S}$ bounded by a curve $\mathcal{C}$

$$\int_{\mathcal{S}}\mathbf{B}\boldsymbol{\cdot}d\mathbf{a}=\int_{\mathcal{S}} (\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{A})\boldsymbol{\cdot}d\mathbf{a}=\oint_{\mathcal{C}} \mathbf{A}\boldsymbol{\cdot}d\mathbf{l}$$

where the last equality follows from Stokes' theorem. (Note that surface is not required to be closed; if it is closed, the line integral is zero.) Inside the sphere, choose any loop with $r_{loop} < a$ that is parallel to the $x-y$ plane centered on the $z$-axis to compute $A_{\phi}$, which by symmetry$^*$ must be constant around the loop. Then

$$\oint \mathbf{A}(r,\theta,\phi)\boldsymbol{\cdot}d\mathbf{l}=\oint A_{\phi}(r,\theta) r_{loop}d\phi=2\pi r_{loop} A_{\phi}(r,\theta)=2\pi r\sin\theta A_{\phi}$$

where $r_{loop}$ was written in spherical coordinates using $r_{loop}=r\sin\theta$. 

$^*$ The symmetry argument is that $A_{\phi}$ does not depend on $\phi$ because the geometry is invariant with a rotation by $\phi$. 

At this point we have not addressed $A_r$ and $A_{\theta}$. Providing a symmetry argument for why these are zero is somewhat complicated, in part because an argument is needed for loops that are fully inside or outside of the sphere. Inside the sphere, one could use the same arguments used to justify a uniform magnetic field inside of a long solenoid. Outside the sphere, one would need to make an argument for why after integration, $\int \mathbf{\thinspace d^3x'/|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|$ will only have a $\phi$ component. As an alternative, one could use the fact that if $A_r=0$ and $A_{\theta}=0$, $\mathbf{B}=\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{A}$ and $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{A}=0$ and use uniqueness to justify the claim $A_r=0$ and $A_{\theta}=0$.

The magnetic field is constant, so the flux calculation does not require integration:

$$\int \mathbf{B}\boldsymbol{\cdot}d\mathbf{a}=B_{iz}\pi r_{loop}^2=B_{iz}\pi(r\sin\theta)^2$$

Solving for $A_{\phi}$ gives

$$A_{\phi i}=\frac{B_{iz}}{2}r\sin\theta=\frac{1}{3}\mu_oM_or\sin\theta$$

Outside the sphere, one must choose a loop with $r_{loop} > a$ that is above or below the $x-y$ plane (choosing a loop in the $x-y$ plane will give $A_{\phi}$ that is only valid for $\theta=\pi/2$). Note that if the loop is at $|z|<a$, the flux is computed using both the inside and outside magnetic field. To compute the flux, it is most convenient to use the cylindrical equation for $\mathbf{B}$, which is

$$B_{zo}(s,z)=\mu_o\frac{M_oa^3}{3}\frac{2z^2-s^2}{(s^2+z^2)^{5/2}}$$

For $|z|\lt a$, the flux calculation requires adding the flux through the area inside inside the sphere to the flux through the area outside the sphere:

$$\int \mathbf{B}\boldsymbol{\cdot}d\mathbf{a} = B_{zi} \pi (a\sin\theta)^2 +  \int_0^{2\pi}\int_{a\sin\theta}^{s}B_{zo}(s')s'ds'd\phi $$

Using $B_{zi}=\frac{2}{3}\mu_oM_o$,

$$\int \mathbf{B}\boldsymbol{\cdot}d\mathbf{a} = \frac{2}{3}\mu_oM_o\pi (a\sin\theta)^2 +  \int_0^{2\pi}\int_{a\sin\theta}^{s}B_{zo}(s')s'ds'd\phi$$

$$\int_0^{2\pi}\int_{a\sin\theta}^{s}B_{zo}(s')s'ds'd\phi =\mu_o\frac{2\pi M_oa^3}{3}\int_{a\sin\theta}^{s}\frac{2z^2-s^2}{(s^2+z^2)^{5/2}}s'ds'$$

$$
\begin{align}
\int_{a\sin\theta}^{s}\frac{2z^2-s^2}{(s^2+z^2)^{5/2}}s'ds' & = \left[-\frac{2}{3}\frac{z^2}{(s^2+z^2)^{3/2}}+\frac{s^2+\frac{2}{3}z^2}{(s^2+z^2)^{3/2}}\right]_{a\sin\theta}^{s}\\
& =-\frac{2}{3}\frac{z^2}{(s^2+z^2)^{3/2}}+\frac{s^2+\frac{2}{3}z^2}{(s^2+z^2)^{3/2}}+\frac{2}{3}\frac{z^2}{(a^2\sin^2\theta+z^2)^{3/2}}-\frac{a^2\sin^2\theta+\frac{2}{3}z^2}{(a^2\sin^2\theta+z^2)^{3/2}}\\
& =-\frac{2}{3}\frac{z^2}{r^3}+\frac{s^2+\frac{2}{3}z^2}{r^3}+\frac{2}{3}\frac{z^2}{a^3}-\frac{a^2\sin^2\theta+\frac{2}{3}z^2}{a^3}\\
& =\frac{s^2}{r^3}-\frac{a^2\sin^2\theta}{a^3}
\end{align}
$$

where $a^2\sin^2\theta+z^2=a^2$ and $r^2=s^2+z^2$ was used.

and the line integral of $\mathbf{A}$ is the same as it was when the area was fully inside the sphere.

$$
\begin{align}
\int \mathbf{B}\boldsymbol{\cdot}d\mathbf{a} & = \frac{2}{3}\mu_oM_o\pi (a\sin\theta)^2 +  \mu_o\frac{2\pi M_oa^3}{3}\left[\frac{s^2}{r^3}-\frac{a^2\sin^2\theta}{a^3}\right]\\
& = \mu_o\frac{2\pi M_oa^3}{3}\frac{s^2}{r^3}\\
& = \mu_o\frac{2\pi M_oa^3}{3}\frac{\sin^2\theta}{r}
\end{align}
$$

Setting this equal to $\oint\mathbf{A}\cdot d\mathbf{l}=2\pi r\sin\theta A_{\phi}$ and solving for $A_{\phi o}$ gives

$$A_{\phi o}=\mu_o\frac{M_oa^2}{3}\frac{\sin\theta}{r^2}$$

Recall that this solution is only valid for $|z|\le a$. For $|z|\gt a$, the only contribution to the flux is from the magnetic field outside of the sphere: 

$$\int \mathbf{B}\boldsymbol{\cdot}d\mathbf{a}=\int_0^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{s}B_{zo}(s')s'ds'd\phi$$

Evaluation of this integral will give the same result as the flux integral for $|z|\le a$ and so the vector potential outside the sphere is the same and given by $A_{\phi o}$ found above.

## Cylinder Boundary Value Problem 

A  cylinder of radius $s_o$ has a magnetization

$$\mathbf{M}=(ps\sin 2\phi + qs\cos\phi)\hat{\mathbf{s}}+(\frac{1}{2}ps\cos 2\phi-qs\sin\phi)\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$$ 

where $s$ is the cylindrical radial coordinate and $p$ and $q$ are constants. Find $\mathbf{B}$ due to the cylinder.

Use similar boundary conditions as the previous problem (replacing the spherical coordinate system radius $r$ with the cylindrical coordinate system radius $s$). In addition, note that the absence of magnetic monopoles means that $\psi_m$ cannot scale as $\ln s$ for large $s$.

<div style="background-color:yellow">
There is an error in the $M_{\phi}$ term. It should be
$$\mathbf{M}=(p\rho\sin 2\phi + q\rho\cos\phi)\hat{\boldsymbol{\rho}}+(p\rho\cos 2\phi-2q\rho\sin\phi)\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$$ where $p$ and $q$ are constants. Also, assume the cylinder is long.

$$\mathbf{M}=(p\rho\sin 2\phi + q\rho\cos\phi)\hat{\boldsymbol{\rho}}+(p\rho\cos 2\phi-2q\rho\sin\phi)\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$$

$$\psi_i=\frac{q}{2}ss_o\cos\phi+\frac{p}{4}s^2\sin 2\phi$$

$$\psi_o=\frac{q}{2}\frac{s_o^3}{s}\cos\phi+\frac{p}{4}\frac{s_o^4}{s^2}\sin 2\phi$$

An alternative way of obtaining a solution is to note that 
    
$$\mathbf{K}_b=\mathbf{M}\times\hat{\mathbf{n}}=M_o\hat{\mathbf{z}}\times\hat{\mathbf{s}}=M_o\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$$
    
$$\mathbf{J}_b=\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\mathbf{M}=0$$

Therefore, the problem is equivalent to a solenoid with a finite length with a surface current of $K_{\phi}=2M_o/\mu_o$. The method of solution suggested here is intentionally more complex as it applies to a more general set of problems.

1.

The macroscopic Maxwell equations associated with the magnetic field are 

$$\boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{B}=0\quad\text{and}\quad \boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\mathbf{H}=\mathbf{J}_f$$

where $\mathbf{J}_f$ is the free current (i.e., not bound current). Using the definition of the magnetization implied by $\mathbf{B}=\mu_o(\mathbf{H}+\mathbf{M})$ and $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{B}=0$, the macroscopic equations can be written as

$$\boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{H}=-\boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}\quad\text{and}\quad \boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\mathbf{H}=\mathbf{J}_f$$

When $\mathbf{J}_f=0$, $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\mathbf{H}=0$ so one can write $\mathbf{H}$ as the gradient of a scalar function that will be called $\psi_m$: $\mathbf{H}=-\boldsymbol{\nabla}\psi_m$ and so

$$\nabla^2\psi_m=\boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}$$

From this, it follows that

$$\psi_m=-\frac{1}{4\pi}\int\frac{\boldsymbol{\nabla}'\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}d^3x'$$

If $\mathbf{M}$ has a discontinuity on a surface $\mathcal{S}$ of the volume $\mathcal{V}$ such that it is zero outside of $\mathcal{V}$, this can be written as

$$\psi_m=-\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_V\frac{\boldsymbol{\nabla}'\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}d^3x'+\frac{1}{4\pi}\oint_S\frac{\hat{\mathbf{n}}'\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}da'$$

In this problem, the first form 

$$\psi_m=-\frac{1}{4\pi}\int\frac{\boldsymbol{\nabla}'\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}d^3x'$$

can be used if $\mathbf{M}$ is represented using the Heaviside step function $\Theta$:

$$\mathbf{M}=M_o\Theta(a-s)\Big[\Theta(z+L)-\Theta(z-L)\Big]\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

so that

$$
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}=&\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left(M_o\Theta(a-s)\big[\Theta(z+L)-\Theta(z-L)\big]\right)\\
\\
#&\thinspaceM_o\Theta(a-s)\big[\delta(z+L)-\delta(z-L)\big]
\end{align}
$$

(Verify graphically that this makes sense by plotting $M$ as a function of $z$; for example when $z=L$, from the graph we expect the slope of $\frac{\partial M_z}{\partial z}$ to be $-\infty$.)

(This solution requires a few more steps than using the alternative form for $\psi_m$ but here I'll use this approach as a review of the $\Theta$ and $\delta$ functions.)

For points on the $z-$axis,

$$\mathbf{x}=z\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

and

$$\mathbf{x}'=x'\hat{\mathbf{x}}+y'\hat{\mathbf{y}}+z'\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

$$
\begin{align}
\psi_m & =-\frac{M_o}{4\pi}\int_0^{\infty}\int_0^{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\Theta(a-s')\left(\delta(z+L)-\delta(z-L)\right)}{\sqrt{s'^2+(z-z')^2}}s'ds' d\phi' dz'\\
& =-\frac{M_o}{4\pi}\int_0^{a}\int_0^{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\delta(z+L)-\delta(z-L)}{\sqrt{s'^2+(z-z')^2}}s'ds' d\phi' dz'\\
&=-\frac{M_o}{4\pi}\int_0^{a}\int_0^{2\pi}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{s'^2+(z+L)^2}}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{s'^2+(z-L)^2}}\right)s'ds' d\phi'\\
& =-\frac{M_o}{2}\int_0^{a}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{s'^2+(z+L)^2}}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{s'^2+(z-L)^2}}\right)s'ds'\\
& =-\frac{M_o}{2}\int_0^{a}\left(\frac{1}{|z+L|\sqrt{1+s'^2/(z+L)^2}}-\frac{1}{|z-L|\sqrt{1+s'^2/(z-L)^2}}\right)s'ds'
\end{align}
$$

Several students attempted to use the expansion of $1/|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|$ with $r=z$ in terms of Legendre polynomials. This is a good idea, but there are several complications.

Complication A: One could use the last two equations on page 103 of Jackson to conclude that

$$\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\frac{c^l}{z^{l+1}}P_l(\cos\alpha)\qquad z\gt c$$

$$\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\frac{z^{l+1}}{c^l}P_l(\cos\alpha)\qquad z\lt c$$

where $\cos\alpha=L/\sqrt{s'^2+L^2}$ and $c=\sqrt{s'^2+L^2}$. To find the potential for a disk of charge, one needs to integrate from $s'=0$ to $s'=b$. This integration is complicated by the fact that the argument to the Legendre polynomials depends on $s'$. For this problem, there is a similar complication as one also needs to integrate from $s'=0$ to $s'=b$.

Complication B:  The expansions given above are for $z\gt c$ and $z\lt c$. So if you integrated these expansions, the result would be valid for $z\gt c_{max}$ and $z\lt c_{max}$, where $c^2_{max}=b^2+L^2$. However, the problem statement asks for the potential when $z\pm L\gg b$, which is not the same as either of these conditions. (To see this, draw out the regions where the solutions apply for $z\gt c_{max}$, $z\lt c_{max}$, and $z\pm L\gg b$). The region $z\pm L\gg b$ corresponds to a $z$ that is a large distance away from both caps. If $L$ is large compared to $b$, such a point could be the origin.

The equation in the steps shown above that occurs after evaluation of the Heavyside step and Dirac delta functions is what would have been found if we had started with

$$\psi_m=-\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{\mathcal{V}}\frac{\boldsymbol{\nabla}'\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}d^3x'+\frac{1}{4\pi}\oint_{\mathcal{S}}\frac{\hat{\mathbf{n}}'\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}da'$$
 
Inside $\mathcal{V}$, $\boldsymbol{\nabla}'\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}=0$, which leaves only the surface integral. The surface integral on the curved surface of the cylinder is zero because $\hat{\mathbf{s}}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}$; the top and bottom caps of the cylinder only contribute and ($\mathbf{n}=\pm \hat{\mathbf{z}}$ on the top/bottom of the cylinder.

At least one student attempted to use the expansion of $1/|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|$ for $r=z$ in terms of Legendre polynomials. This is a good idea, but there is a complication that one needs to address. The angle $\alpha$ is not $\theta$ and so $P_l(\cos\alpha$ will depend on $\phi$. This complication was discussed at length in my notes on this expansion. See the example for the offset charged ring given in section 3.3 of Jackson for how to handle this.

For $a^2/(z\pm L)^2\ll 1$ and using $(1+\Delta)^n\simeq 1+n\Delta$

$$
\begin{align}
\psi_m & \simeq -\frac{M_o}{2}\int_0^{a}\frac{s'ds'}{|z+L|}\left(1-\frac{s'^2}{2(z+L)^2}\right) + \frac{M_o}{2}\int_0^{a}\frac{s'ds'}{|z-L|}\left(1-\frac{s'^2}{2(z-L)^2}\right)\\\\
& = \frac{M_o}{2}\left[\frac{a^2}{2}\left(\frac{1}{|z-L|}-\frac{1}{|z+L|}\right)+\frac{a^4}{4}\left(\frac{1}{|z-L|^3}-\frac{1}{|z+L|^3}\right)\right]
\end{align}
$$

The absolute value signs are important here. If the condition was $a^2/(z\pm L)^2\lt 1$, it would mean that we are finding a solution that applies to all points on the $z$-axis except in a region of $\pm a$ above and below the ends of the cylinder. If $L\gg a$, the region where the solution is valid would include the origin and $z\gg L$ and these regions have a different functional for for the potential.

2.

The exact integral of

$$\psi_m=-\frac{M_o}{2}\int_0^{a}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{s'^2+(z+L)^2}}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{s'^2+(z-L)^2}}\right)s'ds'$$

is

$$\psi_m=\frac{M_o}{2}\left(\sqrt{a^2+(z-L)^2}-\sqrt{a^2+(z+L)^2}-|z-L|+|z+L|\right)$$

When the absolute values are accounted for, the potential function depends on if the point is inside or outside of the cylinder:

$$
\psi_m=\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\frac{M_o}{2}\left(\sqrt{a^2+(z-L)^2}-\sqrt{a^2+(z+L)^2}+2z\right) & \mbox{if } |z| \le L \\
\frac{M_o}{2}\left(\sqrt{a^2+(z-L)^2}-\sqrt{a^2+(z+L)^2}+2L\right) & \mbox{if } |z| \ge L
\end{array}
\right.
$$

To verify consistency with the approximate answer, factor out $z\pm L$ from the square root terms and use $(1+\Delta)^n\simeq 1+n\Delta$ with $\Delta = a/(z\pm L)$. (And be careful to use $\sqrt{u^2}=|u|$ when $u$ can be positive or negative!

$$
\begin{align}
\psi_m & = \frac{M_o}{2}\left(\sqrt{a^2+(z-L)^2}-\sqrt{a^2+(z+L)^2}-|z-L|+|z+L|\right)\\\\
& = \frac{M_o}{2}\left(|z-L|\sqrt{1+a^2/(z-L)^2}-|z+L|\sqrt{1+a^2/(z+L)^2}-|z-L|+|z+L|\right)\\\\
& \simeq \frac{M_o}{2}\frac{a^2}{2}\left(\frac{|z-L|}{(z-L)^2}-\frac{|z+L|}{(z+L)^2}\right)\\\\
& = \frac{M_oa^2}{4}\left(\frac{1}{|z-L|}-\frac{1}{|z+L|}\right)
\end{align}
$$

3.

Using

$$
\begin{align}
\mathbf{B}(z) & =\mu_o\mathbf{H}(z)+\mu_o\mathbf{M}(z)\\
& =-\mu_o\boldsymbol{\nabla}\psi_{m}+\mu_oM_o\big[\Theta(z+L)-\Theta(z-L)\big]\hat{\mathbf{z}}
\end{align}
$$

and

$$\boldsymbol{\nabla}\psi_{m}=\hat{\mathbf{z}}\frac{\partial \psi_m}{\partial z}$$

and recalling that $\partial |x|/\partial x=x/|x|$ gives

$$\frac{\partial \psi_m}{\partial z}=\frac{M_o}{2}\left(\frac{z-L}{\sqrt{a^2+(z-L)^2}}-\frac{z+L}{\sqrt{a^2+(z+L)^2}}-\frac{z-L}{|z-L|}+\frac{z+L}{|z+L|}\right)$$

(An alternative is to use the form of the solution given that applies inside and outside of the cylinder and then compute their derivatives separately to avoid needing to use $\partial |x|/\partial x=x/|x|$.)

The solution depends whether $z$ corresponds to inside or outside of the cylinder:

$|z|\ge L$
$$H_z=-\frac{\partial \psi_m}{\partial z}=-\frac{M_o}{2}\left(\frac{z-L}{\sqrt{a^2+(z-L)^2}}-\frac{z+L}{\sqrt{a^2+(z+L)^2}}\right)$$

$|z|\le L$
$$H_z=-\frac{\partial \psi_m}{\partial z}=-\frac{M_o}{2}\left(\frac{z-L}{\sqrt{a^2+(z-L)^2}}-\frac{z+L}{\sqrt{a^2+(z+L)^2}}+2\right)$$

This, along with the evaluation of the step function in the equation above for $\mathbf{B}(z)$ gives a single equation for the magnetic field

$$\mathbf{B}=\frac{\mu_oM_o}{2}\left[\frac{z+L}{\sqrt{a^2+(z+L)^2}}-\frac{z-L}{\sqrt{a^2+(z-L)^2}}\right]$$
    
So the system is equivalent to a solenoid of height $L$ and radius $a$, which is a standard example problem with a solution along the $z-$axis of

$$B_z=\frac{\mu_o K}{2}\left[\frac{z+L}{\sqrt{a^2+(z+L)^2}}-\frac{z-L}{\sqrt{a^2+(z-L)^2}}\right]$$

This observation also points to another way to check your answer. In the limit that $z\gg a \gg L$, the field should approach that from a magnetic dipole along its axis. In this limit, the cylinder looks like a ring, which has an axial field of

$$B_z=\frac{\mu_o Ia^2}{2}\frac{1}{(a^2+z^2)^{3/2}}$$

## Method of Images Review 

Consider the problem of finding the potential $\Phi(\mathbf{x})$ above a grounded and infinite conducting plane when a point charge $q$ is placed above it. (Recall that $\Phi(\mathbf{x})$ is short-hand for $\Phi(x,y,z)$.) 

Assume the conducting plane is in the $x$-$y$ plane and the charge $q$ is placed at at $(x,y,z)=(0,0,z_o)$ 

Due to the point charges, a surface charge density will appear on the conducting plane. To calculate $\Phi(\mathbf{x})$, one needs to know this surface charge density. However, we can't use the direct integration formula used for continuous charge distributions

$$\Phi(\mathbf{x})= \Phi_q(\mathbf{x}) + \int_{plane}\frac{k\thinspace\sigma(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'\thinspace da'$$

because we don't know $\sigma$. ($\Phi_q(\mathbf{x})$ is the potential due to the point charge $q$).

To find $\Phi(\mathbf{x})$, one finds the potential due to a alternantive charge configuration: a point charge $q$ at $(x,y,z) = (0,0,z_o)$ and a point charge $-q$ at $(x,y,z) = (0,0,-z_o)$.

## Delta Function (5 pts) 

A charge $Q$ is uniformly distributed on the surface of a sphere of radius $b$. 

Write the equation for the charge density using the Dirac delta function.

{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! align="left" |&nbsp;Answer
|-

$$\rho = \frac{Q}{4\pi b^2}\delta(r-b)$$

Or, equivalently,

$$\rho = \frac{Q}{4\pi r^2}\delta(r-b)$$

Both satisfy

$$Q=\int\rho(\mathbf{x\thinspace d^3x = \int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_0^{\pi}\int_0^{\infty} \rho(\mathbf{x})\thinspacer^2 dr\sin\the\thinspace d\the\thinspace d\phi$$

and are zero everywhere except at $r=b$.

This charge density is easy to guess and verify. Earlier in the semester, I went over the derivation for problems like this. The charge density should be zero everywhere except at $r=b$ and the integral of charge density should be $Q$. Given the problem statement, one can write

$$\rho=C\delta(r-b)$$

and determine the constant $C$ from

$$Q = \int \r\thinspace d^3x$$

where the integral is over all space. In spherical coordinates, for $\rho=\rho(r)$,

$$Q = 4\pi\int_0^{\infty}\rho\thinspacer^2dr=4\pi\int_0^{\infty}C\delta(r-b)r^2dr=C4\pi b^2$$

This gives $C=Q/4\pi b^2$ so that

$$\rho = \frac{Q}{4\pi b^2}\delta(r-b)$$

In the problem statement, I did not ask for the volume charge density. However, this is implied as the delta function is always used to write volume charge densities - part of the motivation for introducing it is so that we don't need to write three equations for the electric field - one for a line of charge, one for a surface charge, and one for a volume charge. With the delta function, only the volume charge equation is needed and the volume integral will reduce to either a surface or line integral.

## Capacitance (20 pts) 

A charge of $+Q$ is put on a conducting sphere of radius $b$ and $-Q$ on a sphere of radius $c$. The centers of the spheres are separated by a distance $d$.

1. Describe how the surface charge density on the spheres will change as $d$ increases.
1. Estimate the capacitance assuming $b<<d$ and $c<<d$. (By estimate, I mean that you do not need to solve the boundary value problem to compute the exact potential.) 
1. If the exact capacitance was computed, would it be larger or smaller than your answer to part 2.?

{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! align="left" |&nbsp;Solution
|-

1.

As $d$ increases, the surface charge distribution will become more uniform (the field due to charges on sphere $b$ does not affect the surface charge distribution on sphere $c$ when they are separated by a large distance, and vice-versa).

2.

Capacitance is determined by placing $+Q$ on one surface and $-Q$ on the other. Then, the potential difference between the surfaces, $\Delta V$, is computed and the capacitance is $C=Q/|\Delta V|$.

If $d=\infty$, the potential on the surface of $b$ is due only to the charges on sphere $b$. Similar for $c$.

Assuming $\Psi(r=\infty)=0$, the at the surface of sphere $b$,

$$\Psi_b(r=b) = \frac{kQ}{b}$$

and at the surface of $c$,

$$\Psi_c(r=c) = -\frac{kQ}{c}$$

The potential difference is

$$\Delta V=\Psi_b(r=b)-\Psi_c(r=c)=kQ\left(\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}\right)$$

So the capacitance is

$$C\equiv \frac{Q}{|\Delta V|} = 4\pi\epsilon_o\frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}\right)}$$

(When I went over this in class, someone asked if we could set the potential of sphere $b$ to be zero. I said no, but did not clarify. You can, but then you need to account for the fact that the potential of sphere $c$ will not be simply $-kQ/c$. If you set the potential of sphere $b$ to be zero, then the potential at $r=\infty$ is not zero. It will be $\Psi_{\infty}=-kQ/b$. Then the potential of sphere $c$ is $-kQ/b-kQ/c$ and $\Delta V$ is the same as found above.

3. 

I was looking for any answer that involved a statement about either of the following effects:

1. the electric field between the spheres is different when the charges are not uniformly distributed
1. as $d$ increases, the integration of the electric field is over a larger distance

Several students mentioned that the net charge on the spheres would change as $d$ increased. This is true of the spheres are connected to a battery, but no battery was mentioned. Recall that capacitance can be computed in two ways: (1) assuming $\pm Q$ the conductors and that they are isolated and finding the potential outside the conductors (usually via the electric field) and (2) assuming the conductors are held at a potential difference (by, for example, a battery), computing the potential outside of the conductors, and then computing the charge density (using $d\psi/dn$) and finally the total charge on each conductor.

{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! align="left" |&nbsp;Notes
|-
|
There are two influences on the capacitance - the separation distance and the distribution of charges on the spheres.

1. Suppose $d$ is fixed. The electric field between the spheres will be larger when the charges are shifted towards their faces versus then when they are uniformly distributed. In this case, the electric field and potential difference between the spheres will be smaller for a uniform charge distribution. Given that a uniform charge distribution is associated with large $d$, the capacitance is expected to increase as $d$ increases. 
1. Suppose the charge distribution is fixed (so the electric field equation does not change when $d$ changes). As $d$ increases, the integration of the electric field is over a larger distance and so the potential difference increases. The result is a decrease in capacitance. (This effect is apparent in the formula for the capacitance of two large parallel plates: $C=\epsilon_oA/d$ - as $d$ increases, $C$ decreases.)

The second effect turns out to dominate. As $d$ increases, the capacitance decreases. One can get a capacitance by neglecting the first effect by assuming that the charge distribution on the spheres is uniform. This capacitance will be an upper limit on the actual capacitance.

Assume that sphere $c$ is to the right of sphere $b$.

The total potential is

$$\Psi = \Psi_b + \Psi_c$$

With sphere $b$ centered on the origin and sphere $c$ centered on $x=d$,

$$\Psi_b(x,y,z) = \frac{kQ}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}$$

$$\Psi_c(x,y,z) =  -\frac{kQ}{\sqrt{(x-d)^2+y^2+z^2}}$$

and so

$$\Psi =  \frac{kQ}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}} - \frac{kQ}{\sqrt{(x-d)^2+y^2+z^2}}$$

The potential difference between the surface of $b$ and $c$ can be determined by finding $\Psi$ on each surface. Because $\Psi$ is constant on these surfaces (they are conductors), it is easiest to find the potential difference between the points $(x,y,z)=(b,0,0)$ and $(x,y,z)=(d-c,0,0)$.

$$\Delta V = \Psi(x=b,0,0) - \Psi(x=d-c,0,0) = kQ\left(\frac{1}{b}-\frac{1}{d-b}-\left(\frac{1}{d-c}-\frac{1}{c}\right)\right)$$

This equation can be rearranged to find the capacitance

$$C\equiv \frac{Q}{|\Delta V|} = 4\pi\epsilon_o\frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}-\frac{1}{d-b}-\frac{1}{d-c}\right)}$$

The denominator can be re-written as

$$\left(\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}-\frac{1}{d}\frac{1}{1-b/d}-\frac{1}{d}\frac{1}{1-c/d}\right)$$

Using $1/(1-\delta)\simeq 1+\delta$ for $\delta \ll 1$, gives

$$\left(\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}-\frac{1}{d}\frac{1}{1-c/d}-\frac{1}{d}\frac{1}{1-b/d}\right) \simeq \left(\frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{b} - \frac{2}{d}\right)$$

This gives

$$C \simeq 4\pi\epsilon_o\frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{b}- \frac{2}{d}\right)}$$

Using $1/(1-\delta)\simeq 1+\delta$ again

$$C \simeq C_o\left(1 + \frac{2}{d\left(\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}\right)}\right)$$

where

$$C_o= 4\pi\epsilon_o\frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}\right)}$$

is the capacitance found when $d=\infty$ was assumed.  If $b=c$, then this simplifies to

$$C \simeq C_o\left(1 + \frac{b}{d}\right)$$

For details on how to compute the exact capacitance, see [https://www.iue.tuwien.ac.at/phd/wasshuber/node77.html], [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0031-8949/2/3/001], and [http://www.electrostatics.org/images/Banerjee_ESA2014_paper_corrected.pdf].

## Boundary Value Problem (25 pts) 

# Exam 2 

Note that I will not post solutions to these problems until everyone has turned them in (due to illness,  this may be after the end of the semester). Also, I won't provide details on why I have marked parts of your solution is wrong. If you would like to discuss the solutions, feel free to meet with me during office hours or schedule an appointment.

You may not communicate with anyone else on these problems. You may look at references online, but do not post your problem to a forum or ask anyone for help.

## Parallel Plates with Charged Slab 

Due on April 8th before class starts.

In [[#HW_5|HW #5]], you found $G_D(x,x')$ and used it to find the potential $\Phi$, the potential between the conductors, when the space between the conductors was filled with a non-conducting slab with a uniform charge density - $\rho(x) = \rho_o$.

1. Find $\Phi$ using $G$ from [[#HW_5|HW #5]] and equation 1.44 of Jackson.
1. Find $\Phi$ using Gauss' law and $\psi(b)-\psi(a)=\int_a^b \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{l}$. Provide diagrams and address all surfaces of your Gaussian surface. Do not use the $\Phi$ found in part 1.
1. Compute the surface charge density on the conductor at $x=0$ using $d\Phi/dn=-\sigma/\epsilon_o$.

In the following, subscript $r$ corresponds to potentials and fields for $0\lt x\le d/2$; subscript $r$ corresponds to $d/2\le x\lt d$. For surface charge densities, the subscript indicates the surface at $x=0$ or $x=d$.

'''Boundary Value Method'''

The following solution is written in dimensionless form using the replacements

$\psi \rightarrow \psi/(\rho_od^2/\epsilon_o)$, $x\rightarrow x/d$, $E \rightarrow E/(\rho_od/\epsilon_o)$, and $\sigma \rightarrow \sigma/(\rho_od)$.

Two solutions are computed. For $0\le x\le d/2$, we need to solve Poisson's equation. For $d/2\le x\le d$, we need to solve Laplace's equation. The two solutions are connected using boundary conditions at $x=d/2$.

The Poisson equation $\nabla^2\psi_l=-1$ has the general solution

$$\psi_l = -\frac{1}{2}x^2 + Ax + B$$

Laplace's equation $\nabla^2\psi_r=0$ has the general solution

$$\psi_r = Cx + D$$

Boundary conditions:
1. $\psi_l(0) = 0$
1. $\psi_r(d) = 0$
1. $\psi_l(1/2) = \psi_r(1/2)$
1. $\left[-\partial \psi_r/\partial x + \partial \psi_l/\partial x\right]_{x=1/2}=0$

BC 1. gives $B=0$; BC 2. gives $D=-C$. The potentials can then be written as

$$\psi_l = -\frac{1}{2}x^2 + A\qquad\quad \psi_r = C(x - 1)$$

BC 3. gives

$$-\frac{1}{8}+A\frac{1}{2} = -C\frac{1}{2}\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad \frac{1}{4}-A = C$$

BC 4. gives

$$\frac{1}{2} - A + C = 0\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad -\frac{1}{2} + A = C$$

After solving for $A$ and $C$ using these last two equations,

$$\psi_l(x)=\frac{x}{2}\left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right)$$

$$\psi_r(x)=\frac{1}{8}(1-x)$$

This potential is plotted in [https://www.mathcha.io/editor/kMNEMierUZnHDQYLZBsDZ1B36TLgxqBxh168Mvn Figure 3.]

'''Gauss' Law Method'''

The electric field will be in $x$ direction because conducting planes are large.

Dotted lines in [https://www.mathcha.io/editor/kMNEMierUZnHDQYLZBsDZ1B36TLgxqBxh168Mvn Figure 2.] are a side view of Gaussian cylinders with caps having area $A$. The electric field is parallel to the curved surface of the cylinder so the surface integral for the flux involves only the caps:

$$\oint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{a}=\int_{l\thinspacecap}\mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{a}+\int_{r\thinspacecap}\mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{a}=\frac{Q_{encl}}{\epsilon_o}$$

Gaussian surfaces are shown in [https://www.mathcha.io/editor/kMNEMierUZnHDQYLZBsDZ1B36TLgxqBxh168Mvn Figure 2.]

Gaussian surface 1.

$$\epsilon_oE_{lc}A + \epsilon_oE_lA = \sigma_lA + \rho_oxA$$

$E_{lc}$, the electric field inside the left conductor, is zero so this simplifies to

$$1.\quad\epsilon_oE_l = \sigma_l + \rho_ox$$

Gaussian surface 2.

$$\epsilon_oE_{lc}A + \epsilon_oE_rA = \sigma_lA + \rho_o\frac{d}{2}A$$

Using $E_{lc}=0$ this simplifies to

$$2.\quad\epsilon_oE_r = \sigma_l + \rho_o\frac{d}{2}$$

Gaussian surface 3.

$$\epsilon_oE_{lc}A + \epsilon_oE_{rc}A = \sigma_lA + \rho_o\frac{d}{2}A + \sigma_rA$$

$E_{rc}$, the electric field inside the right conductor, is zero so this simplifies to

$$3.\quad 0 = \sigma_l + \rho_o\frac{d}{2} + \sigma_r$$

The electric field is related to a potential difference by

$$\psi(b)-\psi(a)=-\int_a^b \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{l}$$

{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! align="left" |&nbsp;Note
|-
|
Quite often I see:

$$\psi = -\int \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{l} = -\int_a^b \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{l}$$

This is not correct. Either use the indefinite integral

$$\psi = -\int \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{l}$$

and solve for the constant of integration using the potential at a location where it is known or use the definite integral 

$$\psi(b)-\psi(a)=-\int_a^b \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{l}$$

or

$$\psi(x)-\psi(a)=-\int_a^x \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{l}$$

both of which has no constant of integration.

Also, avoid writing $\psi$ with no argument; use $\psi(x)$ to indicate a potential that depends on position and $\psi(b)$ to indicate the potential at a fixed position, where $b$ is a constant.
|}

The potential difference between the conducting plates is

$$\psi(d) - \psi(0) = -\int_0^dE(\thinspace dx = -\int_0^{d/2}E_l(\thinspace dx - \int_{d/2}^dE\thinspace dx$$

Both plates are grounded so $\phi(0)=\phi(d)=0$ and

$$0 - 0 = -\int_0^{d/2}E_l(\thinspace dx - \frac{d}{2}E_r$$

where the fact that $E_r$ is constant from equation 2. was used. Substituting $E_l$ and $E_r$ found using Gaussian surfaces 1. and 2. gives

$$0 = -\left[\sigma_lx + \rho_o\frac{x^2}{2}\right]_0^{d/2} - \frac{d}{2}\left(\sigma_l + \rho_o\frac{d}{2}\right)$$

This gives

$$\sigma_l=-\frac{3}{8}\rho_od$$

Using $0 = \sigma_l + \frac{1}{2}\rho_od + \sigma_r$ found using Gaussian surface 3.,

$$\sigma_r=-\frac{1}{8}\rho_od$$

Substitution of $\sigma_l$ into equations 1. and 2. gives

$$\epsilon_oE_l = -\frac{3}{8}\rho_od+ \rho_ox$$

$$\epsilon_oE_r = -\frac{3}{8}\rho_od + \frac{1}{2}\rho_od=\frac{1}{8}\rho_od$$

Because the functional form electric field changes at $x=d/2$, we need to find expressions for the potential in each region.

For $x \le d/2$, $\psi_l(x)-\psi(0) = \psi_l(x)=-\int_0^x E_l(x\thinspace dx'$. Integration gives

$$\psi_l(x)=\frac{\rho_o}{\epsilon_o}\frac{x}{2}\left(\frac{3}{4}d-x\right)\qquad x\le d/2$$

For $x \ge d/2$, $\psi_r(x)-\psi(0) = -\int_0^{d/2} E_l(x\thinspace dx'-\int_{d/2}^x E\thinspace dx'$. Integration gives

$$\psi_r(x)=\frac{\rho_o}{\epsilon_o}\frac{d}{8}(d-x)\qquad d/2 \le x\le d$$

The potential has a maximum inside the charged slab at $x=3d/8$.

Checks:

* Just outside of conductor, $\mathbf{E}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} = \sigma/\epsilon_o$ so we expect $E_l(0)=\sigma_l/\epsilon_o$, $E_r(d)=-\sigma_r/\epsilon_o$.
* $E_r$ is constant - this is expected because $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{E} = -\rho/\epsilon_o$ and $\rho=0$ in that region; because problem is 1-D, $\boldsymbol{\nabla}=d/dx$ giving $d E_r/dx = 0\Rightarrow E_r=const$.
* $\psi_l$ and $\psi_r$ satisfy $\psi_l(0)=0$ and $\psi_r(d)=0$ and $\psi_l(d/2)=\psi_r(d/2)$.
* The meaning of $x=3d/8$ - at this value of $x$, the amount of charge to the left is zero: $\sigma_lA+3\rho_oAd/8=0$ as is the amount of charge to the right: $\rho_oAd/8+\sigma_rA+=0$. The slope of the potential is zero and this corresponds to a net force of zero on a test charge and  hence an electric field of zero, which was found.

'''Gauss' Law + Reciprocity Method'''

The reciprocity equation stated in problem 1.12 of Jackson can be used to determine the charge density $\sigma_l$ on the left conductor (see [[#HW_2|HW #2]]). In this case, steps 3. and 4. in the Gauss' Law method are not needed. One can use the equations for $E_r$ and $E_l$ from Gaussian surfaces 1. and 2. in the Gauss' Law method, which depend on only one unknown: $\sigma_l$. The potentials are then found in the same way as before, using

For $x \le d/2$

$$\psi_l(x)-\psi(0) = -\int_0^x E_l dx$$

For $x \ge d/2$

$$\psi_r(x)-\psi(0) = -\int_0^{d/2} E\thinspace dx-\int_{d/2}^x E\thinspace dx$$

'''Green Function Method'''

From HW 5.1, with the replacement of $w$ with $d$,

$$G_D(x,x') = \frac{4\pi}{Ad}\Big[(d-x')x\Theta(x'-x)+(d-x)x'\Theta(x-x')\Big]$$

Let $\mathcal{V}$ be the volume between the plates. On four of the surfaces of $\mathcal{V}$, $\partial G/\partial n'=0$. On two of the surfaces, $\Psi=0$. As a result, the second term in

$$\Psi(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\int_{\mathcal{V}}G_D(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')\rho(\mathbf{x'}) d^3x'-\frac{1}{4\pi}\oint_{\mathcal{S}}\Psi(\mathbf{x}')\frac{\partial G_D}{\partial n'} da'$$

is zero leaving. $G$ does not depend on $y$ and $z$, so this simplifies to

$$\Psi(x)=\frac{A}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\int_0^dG_D(x,x')\rho(x') dx'$$

Using $\rho(x')=\rho_o\Theta(d/2-x')$, the limits of integration are modified

$$\Psi(x)=\frac{A\rho_o}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\int_0^{d/2}G_D(x,x') dx'$$

Substitution of $G_D(x,x')$ in this equation gives

$$\Psi(x)=\frac{\rho_o}{d\epsilon_o}\int_0^{d/2}\Big[(d-x')x\Theta(x'-x)+(d-x)x'\Theta(x-x')\Big] dx'$$

The arguments to the $\Theta$ depend on $x$. By plotting $\Theta(x'-x)$ and $\Theta(x-x')$, one can see that that the limits of integration will depend on $x$.

If $x \gt d/2$, and for the limits of integration that correspond to $x'=[0,d/2]$,

$\Theta(x'-x)=0$ and $\Theta(x-x')=1$ for all $x'$.

Calling the potential for $x \gt d/2$ $\Psi_r$, the required integration is of the second term in $G$:

$$\Psi_r(x)=\frac{\rho_o}{d\epsilon_o}\int_0^{d/2}(d-x)\thinspace dx'$$

$$\Psi_r(x)=\frac{\rho_o}{\epsilon_o}\frac{d}{8}(d-x)$$

If $x \lt d/2$, and for the limits of integration that correspond to $x'=[0,d/2]$, 

$\Theta(x'-x)=1$ only when $x'\gt x$ and

$\Theta(x-x')=1$ only when $x'\lt x$. 

Using this to modify the limits of integration gives the required integration of

$$\Psi_l(x)=\frac{\rho_o}{d\epsilon_o}\left[\int_x^{d/2}(d-x'\thinspace dx'+\int_0^{x}(d-x)\thinspace dx'\right]$$

$$\Psi_l(x)=\frac{\rho_o}{\epsilon_o}\frac{x}{2}\left(\frac{3}{4}d-x\right)$$

The surface charge densities can be computed and compared with previous answers:

$$\sigma_l=-\epsilon_o\frac{\partial \Psi_l}{\partial x}=-\frac{3}{8}\rho_od$$

$$\sigma_r=\epsilon_o\frac{\partial \Psi_r}{\partial x}=-\frac{1}{8}\rho_od$$

The motivation for asking for the charge densities was as a hint of a way to check your answer.

## U-Shaped Channel 

Due on April 15th before class starts.

A U-shaped, conducting, and grounded channel is shown in Fig. 1a; its cross-section is shown in Fig. 1b. The channel is infinite in the $\pm z$ and the top and bottom parts extend to $x=+\infty$.

An infinitely long (in the $\pm z$-direction) non-conducting sheet of charge with a surface charge density of $\sigma'$ is placed inside the tube at $x=d$ as shown.

[[Image:Uchannel2.png|500px]]

1. Find $\psi(x,y)$

2. Find an equation for the surface charge density at $(x,y)=(0,1/2)$ in the form of an infinite series.

3. For $d=0$, uses Gauss' law to find an expression for the surface charge density at $(x,y)=(0,1/2)$ that is not in the form of an infinite series. Provide a diagram and discuss all surfaces of your Gaussian surface.

4. Find $\psi(x,y)$ when an infinitely long (in the $\pm z$-direction) non-conducting slab of charge with a volume charge density $\rho'$ fill the region between $x=0$ to $x=d$ and $y=0$ to $y=1$

Extra credit: Show that the result of 2. evaluated at $d=0$ is equivalent to the result of 3.

Note: Initial version had $x'$ in part 3. and extra credit statement instead of $d$.

In the following, I used $x'$ instead of $d$ for the location of $\sigma'$. The motivation for using $d$ in the problem statement was to make sure that you knew to change $d$ to $x'$ in $\psi$ when doing the integral for part 4.

Justifications for steps that are the same as used in the previous problem are not repeated.

Outside of the channel, the potential is zero. (The conductor shields the outside from electric fields.) To see this formally, consider a [https://www.mathcha.io/editor/K4BjWfWBUm3TGdOEdHkNBgDcZzznM2CwVxxdl large sphere that encloses the channel] but has a slot corresponding to the surface of the channel. Laplace's equation is satified in the shaded volume. The part of the volume that touches the channel is at a potential of zero. As the radius of the sphere approaches infinity, the surface of the sphere is far away from all charges and so the potential on the outer surface is zero. The potential $\psi=0$ satisfies Laplace's equations and the boundary conditions on the surface of the volume, so the solution for the potential in the volume is zero. 

1.

$$\psi_l(x,y) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n\sin(n\pi y)\sinh(n\pi x)$$

$$\psi_r(x,y) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n\sin(n\pi y)e^{-n\pi x}$$

$$\psi_l(x',y) = \psi_r(x',y)$$

$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \sin(n\pi y)\Big[A_n\sinh(n\pi x')-B_ne^{-n\pi x'}\Big] = 0$$

$$A_n = B_n\frac{e^{-n\pi x'}}{\sinh(n\pi x')}$$

$$\psi_l = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} B_ne^{-n\pi x'}\frac{\sinh(n\pi x)}{\sinh(n\pi x')}\sin(n\pi y)$$

$$\psi_r = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} B_ne^{-n\pi x}\sin(n\pi y)$$

$$\left[-\frac{\partial \psi_r}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial \psi_l}{\partial x}\right]_{x=x'}=\frac{\sigma'}{\epsilon_o}$$

$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n\sin(n\pi y)\left[n\pi e^{-n\pi x'}+n\pi e^{-n\pi x'}\frac{\cosh(n\pi x')}{\sinh(n\pi x')}\right]=\frac{\sigma'}{\epsilon_o}$$

Using $\sinh(u)+\cosh(u)=e^u$, this can be written as

$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n\left(\frac{n\pi }{\sinh(n\pi x')}\right)\sin(n\pi y)=\frac{\sigma'}{\epsilon_o}$$

Multiply both sides by $\sin(l\pi \thinspace dy$ and integrate from $y=0$ to $y=1$ and use

$$
\int_0^1\sin(l\pi y)\sin(n\pi \thinspace dy=
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{2} & \text{if $n=l$}\\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

$$
\int_0^1\sin(l\pi \thinspace dy=
\begin{cases}
\frac{2}{l\pi} & l=1,3,...\\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

$$\psi_l = \frac{4\sigma'}{\pi^2\epsilon_o}\sum_{n=1,3,...}^{\infty} \frac{e^{-n\pi x'}}{n^2} \sinh(n\pi x)\sin(n\pi y)$$

$$\psi_r = \frac{4\sigma'}{\pi^2\epsilon_o}\sum_{n=1,3,...}^{\infty} \frac{e^{-n\pi x}}{n^2} \sinh(n\pi x')\sin(n\pi y)$$

Notice that $\psi_l(x,y;x')=\psi_r(x',y;x)$.

2.

$$\sigma_l(y) = -\epsilon_o\frac{\partial \psi_l}{\partial x}\Bigg|_{x=0}$$

$$\sigma_l(y) = -\frac{4\sigma'}{\pi}\sum_{n=1,3,...}^{\infty} e^{-n\pi x'} \cosh(n\pi 0) \sin(n\pi y) $$

$$\sigma_l(1/2; x'=0) = -\frac{4\sigma'}{\pi}\sum_{n=1,3,...}^{\infty} e^{-n\pi 0}{\cosh(n\pi 0)} \sin(n\pi/2) $$

$$\sigma(1/2; x'=0) = -\frac{4\sigma'}{\pi}\sum_{l=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^l}{2l+1}$$

This sum is a well-known way to generate $\pi$ and it evaluates to $\pi/4$ giving

$$\sigma(1/2; x'=0) = -\sigma'$$

3.

A [https://www.mathcha.io/editor/K4BjWfWBUm3TGdOEdHkNBgDcZzznM2CwVxxdl Gaussian cylinder] centered on $y=1/2$ with one end-cap in the conductor and the other at any $x$ has an enclosed charge of $\sigma'A + \sigma(1/2)$. When $x'=0$, one can compute the field using $\psi_r$ and show that $E_x(x,y)=E_y(x,y)=0$ and so there is no flux through the cylinder. Gauss' law then gives

$$0 = \sigma'A + \sigma A$$

$$\sigma = -\sigma'\qquad\text{(for all }y\text{)}$$

When the sheet of charge is next to the left surface, the surface charge density on that surface is equal and opposite to the surface charge density on the charged sheet. The field everywhere is zero.

If $x'\ne 0$, one would need to account for the flux through the curved surface because $\mathbf{E}\ne 0$ and Gauss' law will not give a simple answer as was the case here.

4.

$$G=\frac{4\pi\epsilon_o}{\sigma' A}[\psi_l(x,x')\Theta(x'-x) + \psi_r(x,x')\Theta(x-x')]$$

If the volume is the volume inside the channel, then the potential is zero on three surfaces of this volume; $\partial G/\partial z$ is zero on two surfaces. The fact that $\partial G/\partial x=0$ on the surface at $x=\infty$ can be shown by direct calculation.

$$\Phi(x) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\int_0^{\infty} G(x,x')\rho(x\thinspace d^3x'$$

Using

$$\rho(x')=\rho_o\Theta(d-x')$$

this is

$$\Phi(x) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\int_0^{\infty} G(x,x')\rho(x\thinspace d^3x'$$

Using $G$ in terms of $\psi_l$ and $\psi_r$, this is

$$\Phi(x) = \frac{\rho_o}{\epsilon_o}\int_0^d \Big[\psi_l(x,x')\Theta(x'-x) + \psi_r(x,x')\Theta(x-x')\Bi\thinspace dx'$$

$$x\lt d$$

$$\Phi(x) = \frac{\rho_o}{\epsilon_o}\left[\int_0^d \psi_l(x,x\thinspace dx' + \int_0^x \psi_r(x,x\thinspace dx'\right]$$

$$\Phi(x) = \frac{4\rho_o}{\pi^3\epsilon_o}\sum_{n=1,3,...}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(n\pi y)}{n^3}[1-e^{-n\pi x} - e^{-n\pi d}\sinh(n\pi x)]$$

$$x\gt d$$

$$\Phi(x) = \frac{\rho_o}{\epsilon_o}\int_0^d \psi\thinspace dx'$$

$$\Phi(x) = \frac{4\rho_o}{\pi^3\epsilon_o}\sum_{n=1,3,...}^{\infty}\frac{\cosh(n\pi d)-1}{n^3}e^{-n\pi x}\sin(n\pi y)$$

## Line of Charge 

Due on April 22nd before class starts.

A line of charge with a charge density of $\lambda$ is on the $z$-axis and extends from $z=-1$ to $z=1$. 

1. For $r\gt 1$, find the coefficients $A_l$ and $B_l$ for the potential expressed in the form

$$\psi(r,\theta)=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\left(A_lr^l + B_lr^{-l-1}\right)P_l(\cos\theta)$$

where $r$ and $\theta$ are the radial and polar angles in spherical coordinates.

2. For $(y,z)=(1,1)$, <span style="background-color:yellow">Correction: $(s,z)=(1,1)$</span> compute the ratio of the exact potential with the potential found from the above equation using only the $l=0, 1$, and $2$ terms.

First, we expect the leading order term to be $2k\lambda L/r$, which is the potential for a charge $2L\lambda$ at the origin, where $L=1$.

1.

In the following, the azimuthal symmetry trick is used.

$$\psi(z) = k\int_{-1}^1\frac{\lambda dz'}{|z-z'|}$$

For $z\gt 1$, $|z-z'| = z-z'$. Using this and $u=z-z'$ gives

$$\psi(z) = k\lambda \int_{z-1}^{z+1}\frac{du}{u}=k\lambda[\ln(z+1)-\ln(z-1)]=k\lambda[\ln(1+1/z)-\ln(1-1/z)]$$

Using the expansion for $\delta \lt 1$

$$\ln(1+\delta)=\delta + \frac{\delta^2}{2} + \frac{\delta^3}{3} + ...$$

so for $z\gt 1$,

$$\psi(z) = k\lambda\left(2\frac{1}{z}+\frac{2}{3}\frac{1}{z^3} + \frac{2}{5}\frac{1}{z^5} + ...\right)$$

And from the azimuthal symmetry trick logic it follows that $B_0=2k\lambda$, $B_2=2k\lambda/3$, $B_4=2k\lambda/5$, $...$ or

$$
B_n=
\begin{cases}
\frac{2k\lambda}{l+1} & \text{for }l = 0, 2, ...\\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

so

$$\psi(r,\theta) = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\frac{2k\lambda}{2l+1}\frac{1}{r^{2l+1}}P_l(\cos\theta)$$

$(s,z)=(1,1) \Rightarrow (r,\theta) = (\sqrt{2},\pi/4)$.

Using $P_2(x)=(3x^2-1)/2$,

$$P_2(\cos(\pi/4))=P_2(1/\sqrt{2})=\frac{1}{2}(3/2-1)=\frac{1}{4}$$

and so

$$
\begin{align}
\psi(1,1) & \approx k\lambda\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{2}{3}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}^3}P_2(1/\sqrt{2})\right) \\
& = k\lambda\sqrt{2}\left(1 + \frac{1}{24}\right)\\
& = 1.4371k\lambda
\end{align}
$$

2.

$$\psi(s,z) = k\int_{-1}^1\frac{\lambda dz'}{\sqrt{(z-z')^2 + s^2}}$$

This integral can be looked up or solved using trigonometric substitutions. The result is

$$\psi(s,z) = k\lambda\ln\left[\frac{1+z+\sqrt{(1+z)^2 + s^2}}{z-1+\sqrt{(z-1)^2 + s^2}}\right]$$

$$\psi(1,1) \approx 1.4436k\lambda$$

$$\frac{\psi_{approx}}{\psi_{exact}}\simeq 1.02$$

The following is a Python script that can be used to explore the accuracy using NumPy's Legendre polynomial functions.

<pre>
import numpy as np

z = 1
s = 1

N = (1+z)+ np.sqrt((1+z)**2 + s**2)
D = -(1-z) + np.sqrt((1-z)**2 + s**2)
psi_e = np.log(N/D)

r = np.sqrt(s**2 + z**2)
x = z/np.sqrt(s**2 + z**2)
psi_a = 2/r + ((2/3)/np.power(r,3))*(1/2)*(3*x**2-1)

print('Exact: {0:.4f}; Approximate: {1:.4f}; Approximate/Exact: {2:.4f}'
      .format(psi_e, psi_a, psi_a/psi_e))

1. Compute solution out to l = 10
c = np.zeros(10)
for k in range(1,10,2):
    c[k-1] = (2/k)/np.power(r,k)
    
l = np.polynomial.legendre.legval(x,c)
print(l)

## Surface Current on Cylinder

1.

'''Method 1.'''

Inside of the cylinder, $\nabla^2\Phi_m=0$ is satisfied. The problem has azimuthal symmetry and so the solutions must be of the form of 

$$\Phi_m(r,\theta)=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\left(A_lr^l + B_lr^{-l-1}\right)P_l(\cos\theta)$$

which has an associated magnetic field of $\mathbf{B}(r,\theta) = -\nabla\Phi_m$.

To find the coefficients $A_l$ and $B_l$, use direct integration to find $\mathbf{B}(z)$. This is a standard textbook example problem and the solution is given in problem 5.3 of Jackson. Due to the uniqueness of solutions to Laplace's equation, the equations for $\mathbf{B}(r,\theta)$ and $\mathbf{B}(z)$ must match when $\theta=0$, in which case $r=z$.

To find $A_l$ and $B_l$, the equation for $\mathbf{B}(z)$ must be written as an expansion in terms of $P_l$.

$$B_z(z) = \frac{\mu_oK}{2}\left[\frac{z+L}{\sqrt{b^2+(z+L)^2}}-\frac{z-L}{\sqrt{b^2+(z-L)^2}}\right]$$

$$B_z(z) = \frac{\mu_oK}{2}\left[\frac{z+L}{\sqrt{b^2+L^2-2zL+z^2}}-\frac{z-L}{\sqrt{b^2+L^2+2zL+z^2}}\right]$$

where $L\equiv 2h$. To write this in terms of $P_l$, one could use a Taylor series expansion as was done to find the potential far away from a collection of point charges. One result of that expansion is an equation for the generating function

$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-2xt+t^2}}=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}P_l(x)t^l$$

Using $\Phi_m(z)=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}z^lA_l$ and

$$B_z(z)=-\mu_o\frac{\partial \Phi_m}{\partial z} = -\mu_o\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}lz^{l-1}A_l$$

one should arrive at, defining $d=L/b$,

$$A_1=-1$$

$$A_2=0$$

$$A_3=\frac{P_1(d)/d-P_2(d)}{3}$$

$$A_4=0$$

$$A_5=\frac{P_3(d)/d-P_4(d)}{5}$$

$$...$$

or

$$P_l=\frac{P_{l-2}(d)/d-P_{l-1}(d)}{l}\quad l=3,5,...$$

$$P_l=0\quad l=2,4,...$$

Similar to electrostatic problems, the constant $A_o$ is arbitrary and cannot be fixed unless one is given $\Phi_m$ at a location in space.

'''Method 2.'''

See [http://dx.doi.org/10.1119/1.4906516], which uses a method that is similar to Method 1., but a general relationship was not derived.

'''Method 3.'''

Use $J_{\phi}=I\sin(\theta'-\theta_o)\delta(r'-r_o)/r_o$ with $r_o=\sqrt{z^2+b^2}$ and $tan\theta_o=b/z$ and follow the steps needed to arrive at Equation 5.44 of Jackson, which is the vector potential due to a ring in the $x-y$ plane and centered on the $z$-axis.  Your equation will be valid for a ring that is shifted by a distance $z$. Set $I=K_odz$ and integrate from $z=-L$ to $z=L$. One will need to use equation 5.47 and integration by parts.

2.

In the limit that $b/L\rightarrow 0$, the system is equivalent to a ring of current at the origin and one can compare this solution to the equation for a ring of current at the origin. In the limit that $b/L\rightarrow \infty$, the system is an infinite solenoid and the field should be constant inside of it.

## Long Cylinder 

For a long, grounded, and hollow cylinder with radius $b$ aligned with, and centered on, the $z$-axis,

1. find $G(s,\phi;s',\phi')$ using the solution to an appropriate method of images problem (as was done in [[S2020/Problems#Sphere|HW 7.2.1]] for a sphere);
1. find $G(s,\phi;s',\phi')$ by finding equations for the potential outside of the cylinder when it is surrounded by a co-aligned cylindrical shell of radius $s'$ with a charge density that is proportional to $\delta(\phi-\phi')$ (similar to what was done in [[S2020/Problems#Sphere|HW 7.2.2]] for a sphere); and
1. use Equation 1.44 of Jackson and a Green function to find the potential outside of the cylinder when it is held at a potential of $V_u$ for $0\lt \phi \lt \pi$ and $V_l$ for $\pi \lt \phi\lt 2\pi$.

4. Find the potential outside of the cylinder for the boundary potential given in part 3. using the boundary value method.

## Spherical Dielectric with Cavity 

A spherical dielectric with permittivity $\epsilon$, inner radius $b$, and outer radius $c$ is centered on the origin. Inside and outside of the dielectric the permittivity is $\epsilon_o$.

There is an external electric field of $E_o\hat{\mathbf{z}}$. 

Find the electric field in all regions of space.

See the analogous magnetism example in Jackson 5.12. All of the mathematical steps are the same and the solution to this problem can be obtained by the replacement of constants.
