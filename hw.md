Due on Feb. 2nd at 4:30 pm. Please turn in a physical copy unless you are absent, in which case you may send me an electronic copy.

## Notation and Delta Function

For a volume charge density $\rho$, the electric field at $\mathbf{r}$ is given by

$$\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r})=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\int\frac{\hat{\textbf{\char"0509}}}{\char"0509^2}\rho(\mathbf{r}')\thinspace d\tau'$$

where $\textbf{\char"0509}=\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'$ and $\mathbf{r}'$ is the location of a charge.

1. For a point charge $Q$ at the origin, $\rho(\mathbf{r})=Q\delta(x)\delta(y)\delta(z)$. Evaluate the above integral using cartesian coordinates and unit vectors and this $\rho$.
2. For a point charge $Q$ at $\mathbf{r}'$, $\rho(\mathbf{r})=Q\delta(x-x')\delta(y-y')\delta(z-z')$. Evaluate the above integral using cartesian coordinates and unit vectors and this $\rho$.

## Delta Function I

1. Suppose $I = \int_{-2}^{2}g(x)dx$. Find $\int_{-1}^{1}g(2x)dx$ and $\int_{-1}^{1}g(-2x)dx$ in terms of $I$. Show graphically why the result makes sense
using $g(x)=x^2$.

2. Show that $\int \delta(bx)f(x)dx = \frac{f(0)}{|b|}$. (That is, show that $\delta(bx)=\delta(x)/|b|$).

## Delta Function II

1. Find $\int \delta(a + bx)f(x)dx$ using either
   1. identity 5. on page 26 of Jackson, 3rd Edition or
   2. using the substition $u=ax+b$.

2. Prove identity 5. on Page 26 of Jackson 3rd edition

   $\displaystyle \delta(f(x))=\sum_i\frac{\delta(x-x_i)}{\left|\frac{df}{dx}(x_i)\right|}$

   where $f(x)$ is assumed to have only simple zeros, located at $x=x_i$. Do this by either
   1. explaing the omitted explanations in [Dennery and Krzywicki 1967, page 237](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0013X5HELBJvBlCsQGFauVVDEFczCLV0y9D) or
   2. Taylor series expanding $f(x)$ around the points $x_i$ where $y(x_i)=0$.

## Divergence Theorem

1. Find the electric field $\mathbf{E}$ due to a non-conducting sphere with a uniform volume charge density $\rho_o$ and radius $b$ that is centered on the origin.
2. Show by direct calculation that

   $$\oint_{\mathcal{S}}\mathbf{E}\bfcdot d\mathbf{a} = \int_{\mathcal{V}} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}\thinspace d^3x$$

   when the volume of integration $\mathcal{V}$ is a sphere centered on the origin with

   1. radius $b/2$
   2. radius $2b$

# HW 2.

## Representing $\rho$ Using $\delta$ and $\Theta$

The step (or Heavyside step) function, $\Theta$, is defined by

$$
\Theta(x) = \begin{cases} 1 & x > 0\\ 0 & x \le 0\end{cases}
$$

$\Theta$ can be used to to express a charge density in a compact mathematical form. For example, instead of stating "a uniformly charged sphere centered on the origin, with total charge $Q$, and radius $b$", we can write $\rho(x,y,z)=\frac{Q}{(4/3)\pi b^3}\Theta(b-r)$. We can verify that when this density is integrated over all space, the result is $Q$:

$\displaystyle\int\rho(\mathbf{x})\thinspace d^3x=\frac{Q}{(4/3)\pi b^3}\int_{0}^{2\pi}d\phi\int_{0}^{\pi}\sin\theta d\theta\int_{0}^{\infty}\Theta(b-r)r^2dr
$

Because $\Theta(b-r)=0$ for $r\ge b$ and $\Theta(b-r)=1$ for $r\lt b$, the limits on the $r$ integral can be modfied and the $\Theta$ function removed:

$\displaystyle\int\rho(\mathbf{x})\thinspace d^3x=\frac{Q}{(4/3)\pi b^3}\int_{0}^{2\pi}d\phi\int_{0}^{\pi}\sin\theta d\theta\int_{0}^{b}r^2dr
$

The integrals above evaluate to the volume of a sphere of radius $b$ so that 

$\displaystyle\int\rho(\mathbf{x})\thinspace d^3x=Q$


%$\displaystyle\phantom{\int\rho(\mathbf{x})\thinspace d^3x}=\frac{Q}{b^3}\int_{-b}^{b}dz\int_{-b}^{b}dy\int_{-b}^{b}dx
%$

%$\displaystyle\phantom{\int\rho(\mathbf{x})\thinspace d^3x}=\frac{Q}{b^3}b^3$

1. Write the piecewise function $
f(x) = \begin{cases} 1 & |x| \lt b\\ 0 & |x| \ge b\end{cases}$ using one or more $\Theta$ functions.
1. Find the volume charge density $\rho$ in cylindrical coordinates in terms of $\delta$ and/or $\Theta$ for an infinitely long cylinder of radius $b$ with a charge density per unit length of $\lambda_o$ uniformly distributed on its surface. Assume that the cylinder's centerline is along the $z$-axis.
2. Repeat 2. assuming the cylinder is finite and extends from $z=-h/2$ to $z=h/2$.

## Green's Reciprocity Theorem

For discrete charges, Green's Reciprocity Theorem for $N$ charges is

$$\sum_{i=1}^{N}\Phi\_i q'\_i=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\Phi'\_i q\_i$$

Consider charges $q_1,q_2$, and $q_3$ at locations $x_1,x_2$, and $x_3$, respectively, on the $x$-axis. At these locations, the potentials are $\Phi_1,\Phi_2,$ and $\Phi_3$, respectively.

If a new system of charges $q'_1,q'_2$, and $q'_3$ is created by placing them at the same locations $x_1,x_2$, and $x_3$, respectively, the potentials at these locations are $\Phi'_1,\Phi'_2,$ and $\Phi'_3$, respectively.

Show that 

$$\sum_{i=1}^{3}\Phi\_i q'\_i=\sum_{i=1}^{3}\Phi'\_i q\_i$$

## Green's Reciprocity Use

1. In class, I partially did problem 1.13 of Jackson 3rd Edition (I only found the net charge on the upper of the plate). Find the net charge on the lower plate. Justify your steps at the level of detail given in class. (I stated an easy way of finding the net charge induced on the lower plate, but I want you to do it the long way, which requires steps similar to the ones used in class.)
2. A point charge at a distance $r$ from the origin is between two grounded spherical conducting shells of radius $b$ and $c$ that are centered on the origin. Find the net charge induced on the surfaces at $b$ and $c$.

For discussion during the next class: In my solution to part 1., I used the continous form of reciprocity. Could I have solved it using the discrete form?

## Green's Identity Derivation 

In one of the steps required to derive his identities (discussed in 1.8 of Jackson, 3rd Edition), Green said: "Consider the divergence of a scalar function $f$ multiplied by a vector function $\mathbf{A}$".

1. Show that

$$\mathbf{\nabla}\bfcdot (f\mathbf{A}) = f\thinspace \mathbf{\nabla}\bfcdot \mathbf{A} + \mathbf{A}\bfcdot(\mathbf{\nabla}f)$$

2. Show that

   $$\int_{\mathcal{V}} f\thinspace\mathbf{\nabla}\bfcdot \mathbf{A}\thinspace d^3x = -\int_{\mathcal{V}}\mathbf{A}\bfcdot(\mathbf{\nabla}f)\thinspace d^3x+\oint_{\mathcal{S}} f\mathbf{A}\bfcdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}\thinspace da$$

  where $\mathcal{V}$ is the volume enclosed by the surface $\mathcal{S}$, $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ is the normal to a differential area element $da$ on $\mathcal{S}$, and $d^3x$ is a differential volume element.

3. Verify the result in 2. by using an $f$, $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ of your choosing.

## Alternative Derivation of Reciprocity for Continuous $\rho$

Consider the integral

$$I = \int_{\mathcal V} \mathbf{E}\bfcdot\mathbf{E}'d^3x$$

1. Use $\mathbf{E}=-\mathbf{\nabla}\Phi$ and the result derived in the previous problem to re-write this equation in terms of a volume integral + a surface integral.

2. Repeat 1. using $\mathbf{E}'=-\mathbf{\nabla}\Phi'$

3. Show how the results from 1. and 2. can be used to show

$$\int_{all\space space}\Phi'\rho\thinspace d^3x = \int_{all\space space}\Phi\rho'\thinspace d^3x$$

which was a result derived in class last week using the discrete form of Green's reciprocity theorem.

### Divergence

Find $\int_{\mathcal{V}} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}\thinspace d^3x$, where $\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field due to a point charge $q$ at $\mathbf{x}'$ and $\mathcal{V}$ is a sphere centered on the origin with radius $b \gt |\mathbf{x}'|$.

### Point Charge Outside of Conducting Sphere

A point charge is at a distance $r$ from the center of a conducting sphere of radius $b \lt r$. Use reciprocity to find the potential on the surface of the sphere.

### Delta and $\Theta$

1. Find the volume charge density $\rho$ in cylindrical coordinates in terms of $\delta$ and/or $\Theta$ for a uniformly charged disk of radius $b$ with charge density $\sigma_o$ that lies in the $x-y$ plane and is centered on the origin. Use $s$ for the radial coordinate in cylindrical coordinates.
2. Use identity 5. on page 26 of Jackson to convert this to spherical coordinates. Use $r$ for the radial coordinate in spherical coordinates.
