# Introduction

After years of experimentation, I have found the following class approach results in the most learning. It is quite different from the usual formula of 1. A lecture (covering topics that can be found in many textbooks), 2. A homework with some problems related to the lecture.

I'd like some feedback on this approach. Please read through the following and fill out the course evaluations (before Sunday at 11:59 pm). You should have a link in your email. I am _most_ interested in written comments, especially on ideas for variations on the approach described below.

# Class Approach

*HW*

The course is centered on the HW problems. They have

1. Basic problems
2. Advanced problems

*In class*

1. Review the fundamentals required for the basic problems on the next HW.
2. Discuss questions about advanced problems just turned in. I don't expect all students will have been able to solve all of the advanced problems fully, but I do expect they will have thought enough about it that my discussion is helpful. I think of the advanced problems as a "primer" so that students will be very interested in the follow-up in-class discussion. 

*My expectations/assumptions*

1. You can read the background theory in books.
2. Class time is better spent discussing topics _after_ you have had a chance to think about them. (I base this on experience; sometimes, I would quiz students on what I lectured on and wonder if 1/2 of the students were actually present.)
3. When you are forced to form questions and verbalize things, you learn and remember. I try to have as much of this as possible during class.

*What I emphasize*

1. Finding and writing good problems. Avoid problems with solutions easily found online. (However, it is often easy to find a solution to a related problem, which is fine because the process of mapping one problem to another is helpful.)
2. Writing detailed solutions that guide your thinking and demonstrate good problem-solving strategies (as opposed to just a few critical steps seen in solutions manuals).
3. Getting students to ask questions. (Often it is difficult to get students to engage, but this semester it was easy.)

*Other thoughts*

1. I learned the most when I had to present solutions in class. I'd like to do that more of this in my classes, but it takes time. Also, most students don't like it.
2. My approach (and the standard approach) does not work for significantly underprepared students. I haven't figured out how to handle this.
3. Probably some will say they prefer take-home exams. I do too. But for core classes, I think closed-book exams are better because they force you to internalize and synthesize information.
4. I'd prefer getting more questions prior to when homeworks are due. You learn a lot from trying to write a sensible question. And often you figure out the answer as you write it.
5. One of the notes I have for this semester is writing up a sort of cheat sheet that highlights the equations and types of problems. I'm very tempted to do it even though it is probably better if students create their own. I may create one for a topic as a template and ask for ones to be created for other topics.
