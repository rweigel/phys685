# HW 10

## Amperes' Law 

A long cylinder carries a current on its surface of density $K_o$ as shown.

<img src="figures/long_cylinder.svg"/>

In cylindrical coordinates, the magnetic field has the general form

$$\mathbf{B}=B_s(s,\phi,z)\hat{\mathbf{s}}+B_{\phi}(s,\phi,z)\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}+B_z(s,\phi,z)\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

Amperes' law can be used to easily compute $B_\phi(s)$ (for all $s$!). The more difficult part is justifying

1. $B_s(s,\phi,z)=0$
1. $B_z(s,\phi,z)=0$
1. $B_{\phi}$ does not depend on $\phi$ and $z$

Provide justifications for 1.--3.

4. It is generally easy to use Ampere's law to to find _one component_ of the magnetic field for cases when Ampere's law applies. The explanation for why Ampere's law applies and what symmetry arguments are needed to show that the the other components of the field are zero are often not appreciated or understood. The problem with this is that it leads to attempts to use Ampere's law when it does not apply and only a vague understanding of the derivation of the magnetic boundary conditions.

   Find two textbooks that describe the use of Ampere's law (on any problem, but the problems described must be identical). Compare their justifications and give your opinion on whether the symmetry arguments we addressed sufficiently. It will be best of everyone does not choose the two obvious textbooks of Jackson and Griffiths.

**Solution**

Recall that Amperes' law generally only gives information about one component of the field (when there is enough symmetry to do so). Arguments are needed to determine all components of the field and why Amperes' law can be used to find one component of the field.

We can answer this question after providing justifications for the following statements.

1. The field due to infinitely long wire along the $z$-axis is in the $\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$ direction.
1. The field due to wires placed uniformly along the surface of a cylinder to form a surface current $K_o$ is in the $\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$ direction.

To show 1., consider a differential element of wire on the $z$-axis at an arbitrary position $z'$.

$$\mathbf{B}_{dI}=\frac{\mu_o I}{4\pi}\frac{d\mathbf{l}\times\hat{\textbf{\char"0509}}}{\char"0509^2}$$

where

$$\mathbf{\char"0509}=s\hat{\mathbf{s}}-z'\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

and

$$d\mathbf{l}=dz'\thinspace\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

The cross product $d\mathbf{l}\times\hat{\textbf{\char"0509}}$ is in the direction $\hat{\mathbf{z}}\times\hat{\mathbf{s}}=\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$. So all differential elements of current on the wire create a $\mathbf{B}$ in the $\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$ direction.

Therefore, the magnetic field due to an infinitely long current--carrying wire is always tangent to a circle centered on the wire and in a plane perpendicular to the wire.

To show 2., consider the magnetic field at a point of interest in the $x$-$y$ plane on the $s$ axis created by the wires placed along the cylindrical surface at equal distances above and below the $s$ axis as shown in the diagram. The current at $U$ and $L$ flows out of the page. Each wire creates a field that is tangent to a circle centered on the wire and with a direction determined by the right-hand rule. The field for the upper and lower wires is not each in the $\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$ in this coordinate system. The $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ components of the fields cancel, leaving only a component in the $\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$ direction. So every wire on the top half of the circle shown has a wire on the bottom half with a canceling $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$-component and so the field must be in the $\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$ direction.

<img src="figures/ampere_long_cylinder.svg"/>

This explains why $B_s=B_z=0$. $B_{\phi}$ does not depend on $\phi$ because the diagram is the same for any $\phi$ (the $x$-axis could be drawn in any direction on this diagram, and the angle $\phi$ is the angle between the $x$-axis and the $\mathbf{s}$ axis). $B_{\phi}$ does not depend on $z$ because the diagram is not changed if the plane shown in the figure was shifted in the $z$ direction.

## Long Cylindrical Shell Containing Magnetizable Material

A long thick cylindrical shell with inner radius $R_i$ and outer radius $R_o$ has a magnetic susceptibility of $\chi_m$ and is initially unmagnetized. The cylinder is centered on the origin and aligned with the $z$--axis.

<img src="figures/long_magnetic_cylinder.svg"/>

There is a long wire that carries current $I_o$ that runs along the $z$--axis.

The total field is given by $\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{B}\_{ext} + \mathbf{B}_{b}$, where $\mathbf{B}_b$ is the field due to $\mathbf{K}_b$ and $\mathbf{J}_b$ that are induced by the external magnetic field due to the current--carrying wire. 

1. Use an analog of Approach 1. in [HW 7.3.1](#7.3.1) to show that $\mathbf{B}=(1+\chi_m)\mathbf{B}\_{ext}$ inside the cylinder. That is, start with $\oint \mathbf{H}\bfcdot d\mathbf{l}=I_{f\thickspace encl}$.
2. Use an analog of Approach 3. in [HW 7.3.1](#7.3.1) to show that $\mathbf{B}=(1+\chi_m)\mathbf{B}\_{ext}$ inside the cylinder. That is, use $\mathbf{M}=(\chi_m/(1+\chi_m))\mathbf{B}/\mu_o$, the equations for $\mathbf{K}\_b$, $\mathbf{J}\_b$, and $\oint\mathbf{B}\bfcdot d\mathbf{l}=\mu_oI_{encl}$.

**Solution**

1\. Use an Amperian loop that is a circle in the $x$--$y$ plane centered on the origin, for which $d\mathbf{l}=sd\phi\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$. Then $\mathbf{H}\bfcdot d\mathbf{l}=H_\phi s d\phi$. Given the system has azimuthal symmetry, $H_\phi$ cannot depend on $\phi$. As a result, $H_\phi$ is a constant with respect to integration and the line integral simplifies:

$$\oint \mathbf{H}\bfcdot d\mathbf{l}=\oint H_\phi s d\phi=H_\phi s\oint d\phi=2\pi s H_\phi$$

In the following, it is assumed that $B_s$ and $B_z$ are zero so that $H_s$ and $H_z$ are zero. The justification for this is given at the end of this solution. Due to the relationship between $\mathbf{M}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ given in the problem statement, the induced magnetization $\mathbf{M}$ has $M_s=0$ and $M_z=0$ 

The free current flowing through the Amperian loop is $I_o$. The sign convention for the line integral is such that $I_{free}=+I_o$ (positive $I_{free}$ corresponds to current flowing through the loop in the direction of thumb when wrapping fingers around loop in the direction of $d\mathbf{l}$).

Thus, from $\mathbf{H}\bfcdot d\mathbf{l}=I_{\text{f encl}}$ we have

$$H_\phi=\frac{I_o}{2\pi s}$$

This equation applies to all $s > 0$. To find $B_\phi$, we use $\mathbf{H}=\mathbf{B}/\mu=\mathbf{B}/[\mu_o(1+\chi_m)]$ and the field due to the current--carrying wire is $B_{\phi\text{ ext}}=\mu_oI_o/2\pi s$, giving

$$
B_\phi=\begin{cases}
\displaystyle\frac{\mu_o I_o}{2\pi s}=B_{\phi\text{ ext}}
& s\lt R_i
\\\\
\displaystyle\frac{\mu_o (1+\chi_m)I_o}{2\pi s} = (1+\chi_m)B_{\phi\text{ ext}}
& R_i\lt s\lt R_o
\\\\
\displaystyle\frac{\mu_o I_o}{2\pi s} = B_{\phi\text{ ext}}
& s\lt R_i
\end{cases}
$$

The field differs from $\mathbf{B}\_\text{ext}$ only inside the material. This is remnicent of problems where $\oint \mathbf{D}\bfcdot d\mathbf{a}=q\_{\text{free encl}}$ was used to find the electric field inside of polarizable material. We can verify this by computing the bound current densities. There will be a bound surface current on the inner and outer surfaces and a volume current density inside the material. These azimuthally symmetric currents do not produce a magnetic field for $s\lt R_i$. For $s\gt R_o$, Ampere's law

$$\oint \mathbf{B}\bfcdot d\mathbf{l}=\mu_o(I_{\text{free}} + I_{\text{b}})$$

can be used. The bound current has contributions from the two surface currents and the volume currents, and their sum is zero.

2\. Let $\chi=\chi_m/[(1+\chi_m)\mu_o]$ and assume $\mathbf{M}=M_\phi(s)\hat{\boldsymbol\phi}$ (justification is given at the end of this solution).

We were given $\mathbf{M}=\chi\mathbf{B}$ and can argue that $\mathbf{M}=M_\phi(s)\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ thus, 

$\mathbf{K}_{b\text{ inner}}=\mathbf{M}(R_i)\times\hat{\mathbf{n}}=M_\phi(R_i)\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}\times(-\hat{\mathbf{s}})=+M_\phi(R_i)\zhat$

$\mathbf{K}_{b\text{ outer}}=\mathbf{M}(R_o)\times\hat{\mathbf{n}}=M_\phi(R_o)\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}\times(+\hat{\mathbf{s}})=-M_\phi(R_o)\zhat$


Using $B_\phi = \chi M_\phi$ gives

$\mathbf{K}_{b\text{ inner}}=+\chi B_\phi(R_i)\zhat$

$\mathbf{K}_{b\text{ outer}}=-\chi B_\phi(R_o)\zhat$

$\displaystyle\mathbf{J}_b=\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\mathbf{M}$

If $\mathbf{M}=M_\phi(s)\hat{\boldsymbol\phi}$, then $\displaystyle\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\mathbf{M}=\frac{1}{s}\frac{\partial}{\partial s}(sM_\phi(s))\zhat$

Using $B_\phi = \chi M_\phi$ gives

$\displaystyle\mathbf{J}_b=\frac{\chi}{s}\frac{\partial}{\partial s}(sB_\phi(s))\zhat$

% Note that a symmetry argument is need to conclude non--phi components of B are zero.


The total field is the sum of the external field and the field created by the bound currents:

$B\_\phi(s)=B_{\phi\text{ }ext} + B_{\phi b}$

Ampere's law for the bound currents gives

$2\pi s B_{\phi b} = \mu_oI_{b\text{ }encl}$

This equation is used in the three regions as follows.

----

$s\lt R_i$

$I_{b\text{ }encl}=0$, so

$2\pi s B_{\phi b} = \mu_oI_{b\text{ }encl}$

gives

$B_{\phi b}=0$, so $B_\phi=B_{\phi\text{ ext}}$

----

$R_i\lt s\lt R_o$

$I_{b\text{ }encl}$ is due to $\mathbf{K}_{b\text{ inner}}$ and $\mathbf{J}_b$ 

$\displaystyle I_{b\text{ }encl}=2\pi R_iK_{b\text{ inner}} + \int_0^{2\pi}\int_{R_i}^s\frac{\chi}{s'}\frac{\partial}{\partial s'}(s'B_\phi(s'))s'ds'$

$\displaystyle I_{b\text{ }encl}=2\pi \chi R_iB_\phi(R_i)+2\pi\chi\big[sB_\phi(s)-R_iB_\phi(R_i)\big]$

The first and last terms cancel, leaving

$\displaystyle I_{b\text{ }encl}=2\pi\chi sB_\phi(s)$

Substitution of this into $2\pi s B_{\phi b} = \mu_oI_{b\text{ }encl}$ from Ampere's law gives

$B_{\phi b}(s)=\chi B_{\phi}(s)$

Substituion into $B\_\phi(s)=B_{\phi\text{ }ext} + B_{\phi b}$ gives

$B\_\phi(s)=B_{\phi\text{ }ext} + \chi B_{\phi}$

and finally

$B_\phi(s)=(1+\chi_m)B_{\phi\text{ }ext}$.

In the above, the bound current due to $\mathbf{J}_b$ was computed using a surface integral. One can 

----

$s\gt R_i$

$I_{b\text{ }encl}$ is the bound current on both surfaces plus the bound current flowing through the volume of the material. It is zero, which follows from

$\displaystyle I_{b\text{ }encl}=2\pi R_iK_{b\text{ inner}} +2\pi R_oK_{b\text{ outer}} + \int_0^{2\pi}\int_{R_i}^{R_o}\frac{\chi}{s'}\frac{\partial}{\partial s'}(s'B_\phi(s'))s'ds'=0$

Note that $\mathbf{J}_b$ is zero explicitly because we have found $B_\phi$ is proportional to $1/s$.

$I_{b\text{ }encl}=0$, so $2\pi s B_{\phi b} = \mu_oI_{b\text{ }encl}$ from Ampere's law gives $B_{\phi b}=0$ and substituion into $B\_\phi(s)=B_{\phi\text{ }ext} + B_{\phi b}$ gives $B\_\phi(s)=B_{\phi\text{ }ext}$

----

In 1. and 2., only $B_\phi$ was found. Ampere's law cannot be used to find $B_s$ and $B_z$.

Symmetry arguments are need to claim $M_\phi=M_\phi(s)$ and $B_s$ and $B_z$ are zero.

* $M_\phi$

    The geometry is invariant with respect to translations in $z$ and rotations by $\phi$. As a result, $\mathbf{B}$ must be independent of $z$ and $\phi$. From $\mathbf{M}=(\chi_m/(1+\chi_m))\mathbf{B}/\mu_o$ it follows that $M_\phi$ must also be independent of $z$ and $\phi$.

* $B_s$

    Suppose that from your perspective $I$ is upwards and $B_s$ is outwards. If you hung upsidedown, you would claim that a downward current corresponds to an outwards $B_s$. However, accoring to the Biot--Savart law, changing the direction of $I$ inverts the direction of the field and so upsidedown you should see an inwards $B_s$. The only way for consistency between the two perspectives is if $B_s$ is zero.

* $B_z$

    We are given that the free current flows in the $\zhat$ and have justified $B_s=0$. 

    If all of the currents (free and bound) flow in the $\zhat$ direction, then $B_z$ must be zero because of the cross product in the Biot--Savart law. If $B_z$ is zero, then $\mathbf{M}$ only has a $\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$ component (because From $\mathbf{M}=(\chi_m/(1+\chi_m))\mathbf{B}/\mu_o$). From the equations for $\mathbf{K}_b$ and $\mathbf{J}_b$, it follows that the bound currents flow in the $\pm \zhat$ direction.

    Suppose $B_z\ne 0$. From $\mathbf{M}(s)=(\chi_m/(1+\chi_m))\mathbf{B}(s)/\mu_o$, $M_z$ would be non--zero. This magnetization would create bound currents in the $\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$ direction. For an infinitely long cylinder, these bound currents would not produce a $B_z$. From this contradiction we can conclude that $B_z$ must be zero.
    
    

%Far from the $z$--axis, the field due to the external and bound currents must approach zero. Ampere's law and the fact that $B_z$ is independent of $z$ can be used to show that $B_z$ is independent of distance from the $z$--axis using a square loop in the $s$--$z$. Together, this implies $B_z=0$. (A similar argument was used to justify $B=0$ outside of a long solenoid in Example 5.9 of Griffiths.)

## Sphere with uniform $\mathbf{M}$ 

In Example 6.1 of Griffiths, 4rd edition, direct integration is used to find $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ for a uniformly magnetized sphere: $\mathbf{M}=M_o\hat{\mathbf{z}}$. The approach is to compute $\mathbf{J}_b$ and $\mathbf{K}_b$ using

$\mathbf{J}_b=\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{M}$ and $\mathbf{K}_b=\mathbf{M}\times\hat{\mathbf{n}}$

Because $\mathbf{J}_b=0$, he starts with

$$\mathbf{A}=\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\int\frac{\mathbf{K}_b}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}da'$$

and integrates to compute $\mathbf{A}$ and then the relationship $\mathbf{B}=\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\mathbf{A}$ is used to find $\mathbf{B}$. 

Chapter 5.10 of Jackson contains a related solution.

In this problem, the boundary value method will be used. 

The Maxwell macroscopic equations for the magnetic field are 

$$\boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{B}=0\quad\text{and}\quad \boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\mathbf{H}=\mathbf{J}_f$$

where $\mathbf{J}_f$ is the free current. Using $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{B}=0$ and the defining relationship for $\mathbf{H}$, which is $\mathbf{B}=\mu_o(\mathbf{H}+\mathbf{M})$, we can write

$$\boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{H}=-\boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}\quad\text{and}\quad \boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\mathbf{H}=\mathbf{J}_f$$

When $\mathbf{J}_f=0$, $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\mathbf{H}=0$ and thus one can write $\mathbf{H}$ as the gradient of a scalar function that will be called $\psi_m$: $\mathbf{H}=-\boldsymbol{\nabla}\psi_m$ and so

$$\nabla^2\psi_m=\boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}$$

For a uniformly magnetized sphere, $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}=0$ except at the surface of the sphere (because $M$ is discontinuous). Therefore, inside and outside the sphere

$$\nabla^2\psi_m=0$$

The problem has azimuthal symmetry, so we can write $\psi_m=\psi_m(r,\theta)$ using the general spherical coordinate solution to Laplace's equation for a problem with azimuthal symmetry:

$$\psi_m(r,\theta)=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\left(A_lr^l + B_lr^{-l-1}\right)P_l(\cos\theta)$$


Using one or more of the boundary conditions

1. $\psi_m$ finite for $r=0$
1. $\psi_m\rightarrow 0$ as $r\rightarrow\infty$
1. $\psi_m$ is continuous
1. $(\mathbf{B}_2-\mathbf{B_1})\boldsymbol{\cdot}\hat{\mathbf{n}}=0$

find $\mathbf{B}$ and then $\mathbf{A}$.

**Solution**

To solve this using the boundary value method, start with

$$\psi(r,\theta)=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\left(A_lr^l + B_lr^{-l-1}\right)P_l(\cos\theta)$$

BC 1. gives $B_l=0$ for the inner potential, $\psi_i$. BC 2. gives $A_l=0$ for the outer potential, $\psi_o$. The potentials thus simplify to

$$\psi_i=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}A_lr^lP_l(\cos\theta)\qquad\psi_o=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\frac{B_l}{r^{l+1}}P_l(\cos\theta)$$

BC 3. gives

$$B_l=A_la^{2l+1}$$

Using $\mathbf{B}=\mu_o(\mathbf{H}+\mathbf{M})$, BC 4., $(\mathbf{B}_2-\mathbf{B_1})\boldsymbol{\cdot}\hat{\mathbf{n}}=0$, can be re-written as

$\Big[\mathbf{H}_o(a,\theta)+\mathbf{M}_o(a,\theta)-\mathbf{H}_i(a,\theta)-\mathbf{M}_i(a,\theta)\Big]\boldsymbol{\cdot}\hat{\mathbf{n}}=0$

Using $\mathbf{M}_o=0$, $\mathbf{M}_i=M_o\hat{\mathbf{z}}$, $\hat{\mathbf{n}}=\hat{\mathbf{r}}$, $\hat{\mathbf{r}}\bfcdot\zhat=\cos\theta$, and $\mathbf{H}=-\boldsymbol{\nabla}\psi_m$ gives

$$-\frac{\partial \psi_o}{\partial r}\Biggm\lvert_{r=a}+\frac{\partial \psi_i}{\partial r}\Biggm\lvert_{r=a}-\thinspace M_o\cos\theta=0$$

From this,

$$A_1=M_o-\frac{2B_1}{a^3}$$

and

$$A_l=-aB_l\frac{l+1}{l}\quad l\ne 1$$

Using $B_l=A_la^{2l+1}$ found from BC 3., the result is

$$B_1=A_1a^3$$

and

$$B_l=A_l=0\quad l\ne 1$$

Finally,

$$\psi_i=\frac{M_o}{3}r\cos\theta\qquad\qquad \psi_o=\frac{M_o}{3}\frac{a^3}{r^2}\cos\theta$$

which is equivalent to Eqn. 5.104 of Jackson.

The gradient in spherical coordinates for a function with no $\phi$ dependence is

$$\boldsymbol{\nabla}=\hat{\mathbf{r}}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}+\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}$$

and so $\mathbf{H}=-\boldsymbol{\nabla}\psi$ gives

$$\mathbf{H}_i=\frac{M_o}{3}\left(-\cos\theta\hat{\mathbf{r}}+\sin\theta\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\right)=-\frac{M_o}{3}\hat{\mathbf{z}}=-\frac{1}{3}\mathbf{M}$$

and

$$\mathbf{H}_o=\frac{M_o}{3}\frac{a^3}{r^3}\left(2\cos\theta\hat{\mathbf{r}}+\sin\theta\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\right)$$

Using $\mathbf{B}=\mu_o(\mathbf{H}+\mathbf{M})$ gives

$$\mathbf{B}_i=\mu_o(\mathbf{H}_i+M_o\hat{\mathbf{z}})=\frac{2}{3}\mu_oM_o\hat{\mathbf{z}}=\frac{2}{3}\mu_o\mathbf{M}$$

and

$$\mathbf{B}_o=\mu_o\mathbf{H}_o=\mu_o\frac{M_o}{3}\frac{a^3}{r^3}\left(2\cos\theta\hat{\mathbf{r}}+\sin\theta\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\right)$$

To compute $\mathbf{A}$, one could use the method given in Jackson section 5.10 (equation 5.109). Alternatively, $\mathbf{A}$ can be arrived at by analogy. 

Outside, $\mathbf{B}$ has the form of of a magnetic dipole $\mathbf{m}=m\zhat$ at the origin, for which the field is (eqn 5.88 of Griffiths)

$$\mathbf{B}_{\text{dipole}}=\frac{\mu_o m}{4\pi r^3}\left(2\cos\theta\hat{\mathbf{r}}+\sin\theta\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\right)$$

As a result, $\mathbf{B}_o$ is equivalent to the field due to a a dipole moment of $\mathbf{m} = \hat{\mathbf{z}}4\pi a^3M_o/3$ at the origin.

Using this with the magnetic dipole equation (eqn 5.55 of Jackson) gives

$$\mathbf{A}_{\text{dipole}}=\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\frac{\mathbf{m}\times \mathbf{r}}{r^3}$$

$$\mathbf{A}_o=\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\frac{\mathbf{m}\times \mathbf{r}}{r^3}=\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\frac{4\pi a^3M_o}{3}\frac{\hat{\mathbf{z}}\times \hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}=\mu_o\frac{M_oa^3}{3}\frac{\sin\theta}{r^2}\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$$

Inside, the magnetic field is uniform, which is the case for an infinitely long solenoid. From example 5.12 of Griffiths the vector potential for an infinitely long solenoid with current $I$ and $n$ turns per unit length is 

$$\mathbf{A}_i=\frac{\mu_o I n}{2}s\thinspace\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$$

The magnetic field inside the solenoid is $\mu_o I n$, so we set this equal to $B_i$ and write

$$\mathbf{A}_i=\frac{B_i}{2}s\thinspace\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$$

The magnitude of the magnetic field inside the sphere is $B_i=2\mu_oM_o/3$, so

$$\mathbf{A}_i=\mu_o\frac{M_o}{3}s\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$$

$s$ is the cylindrical radius, which in spherical coordinates is $s=r\sin\theta$, so finally 

$$\mathbf{A}_i=\mu_o\frac{M_o}{3}r\sin\theta\thinspace\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$$

----

_Alternative approch 1. for $\psi\_m$_

With the direct integration method, one needs to evaluate

$$\psi_m=\frac{1}{4\pi}\oint_S\frac{\hat{\mathbf{n}}'\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}da'$$

(see Jackson equation 5.100).  With $\hat{\mathbf{n}}'=\hat{\mathbf{r}}'$ and $\mathbf{M}=M_o\hat{\mathbf{z}}$, the numerator is

$$\hat{\mathbf{n}}'\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mathbf{M}=M_o\hat{\mathbf{r}}'\boldsymbol{\cdot}\hat{\mathbf{z}}= M_o\cos\theta'$$

and the integral is identical to that for a uniformly polarized sphere or a sphere with a surface charge that varies as $\cos\theta$; both problems are typically given as textbook examples and their solutions can be used to quickly write down the answer. 

----

_Alternative approach 2. for $\psi\_m$_

To check your answers, note that the solution for $\mathbf{A}$ using direct integration is given as an example in Jackson section 5.10 and Griffiths 5.11 and 6.1. (Note the differences in approach to the integration between Jackson and Griffiths).  From this, one can compute $\mathbf{B}=\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{A}$ and then use  $\mathbf{B}=\mu_o(\mathbf{H}+\mathbf{M})$ and $\mathbf{H}=-\nabla\psi_m$ to compute $\psi_m$. 

----

_Alternative approach for $\mathbf{A}$ given $\mathbf{B}$_

An alternative approach to computing $\mathbf{A}$ outside is to use the same approach typically used to compute $\mathbf{A}$ inside an infinitely long solenoid (as in example 5.12 of Griffiths). First, note that the magnetic flux through a surface $\mathcal{S}$ bounded by a curve $\mathcal{C}$ is related to the line integral of $\mathbf{A}$ around $\mathcal{C}$:

$$\int_{\mathcal{S}}\mathbf{B}\boldsymbol{\cdot}d\mathbf{a}=\int_{\mathcal{S}} (\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{A})\boldsymbol{\cdot}d\mathbf{a}=\oint_{\mathcal{C}} \mathbf{A}\boldsymbol{\cdot}d\mathbf{l}$$

where the last equality follows from Stokes' theorem. (Note that surface is not required to be closed; if it is closed, the line integral is zero.)

Inside the sphere, choose any loop with $r_{loop} < a$ that is parallel to the $x-y$ plane centered on the $z$-axis to compute $A_{\phi}$, which by symmetry$^*$ must be constant around the loop. Then

$$\oint \mathbf{A}(r,\theta,\phi)\boldsymbol{\cdot}d\mathbf{l}=\oint A_{\phi}(r,\theta) r_{loop}d\phi=2\pi r_{loop} A_{\phi}(r,\theta)=2\pi r\sin\theta A_{\phi}$$

where $r_{loop}$ was written in spherical coordinates using $r_{loop}=r\sin\theta$. 

$^*$ The symmetry argument is that $A_{\phi}$ does not depend on $\phi$ because the geometry is invariant with a rotation by $\phi$. 

At this point we have not addressed $A_r$ and $A_{\theta}$. Providing a symmetry argument for why these are zero is somewhat complicated, in part because an argument is needed for loops that are fully inside or outside of the sphere. Inside the sphere, one could use the same arguments used to justify a uniform magnetic field inside of a long solenoid. Outside the sphere, one would need to make an argument for why after integration, $\int \mathbf{A} d^3x'/|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|$ will only have a $\phi$ component. As an alternative, one could use the fact that if $A_r=0$ and $A_{\theta}=0$, $\mathbf{B}=\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{A}$ and $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{A}=0$ and use uniqueness to justify the claim $A_r=0$ and $A_{\theta}=0$.

The magnetic field is constant, so the flux calculation does not require integration:

$$\int \mathbf{B}\boldsymbol{\cdot}d\mathbf{a}=B_{iz}\pi r_{loop}^2=B_{iz}\pi(r\sin\theta)^2$$

Solving for $A_{\phi}$ gives

$$A_{\phi i}=\frac{B_{iz}}{2}r\sin\theta=\frac{1}{3}\mu_oM_or\sin\theta$$

Outside the sphere, one must choose a loop with $r_{loop} > a$ that is at a position $z$ above or below the $x-y$ plane (choosing a loop in the $x-y$ plane will give $A_{\phi}$ that is only valid for $\theta=\pi/2$). Note that if the loop is at $|z|<a$, the flux has contributions from both the inside and outside magnetic field. To compute the flux, it is most convenient to use the cylindrical equation for $\mathbf{B}$, which is

$$B_{zo}(s,z)=\mu_o\frac{M_oa^3}{3}\frac{2z^2-s^2}{(s^2+z^2)^{5/2}}$$

For $|z|\lt a$, the flux calculation requires adding the flux through the area inside inside the sphere to the flux through the area outside the sphere:

$$\int \mathbf{B}\boldsymbol{\cdot}d\mathbf{a} = B_{zi} \pi (a\sin\theta)^2 +  \int_0^{2\pi}\int_{a\sin\theta}^{s}B_{zo}(s')s'ds'd\phi $$

Using $B_{zi}=\frac{2}{3}\mu_oM_o$,

$$\int \mathbf{B}\boldsymbol{\cdot}d\mathbf{a} = \frac{2}{3}\mu_oM_o\pi (a\sin\theta)^2 +  \int_0^{2\pi}\int_{a\sin\theta}^{s}B_{zo}(s')s'ds'd\phi$$

$$\int_0^{2\pi}\int_{a\sin\theta}^{s}B_{zo}(s')s'ds'd\phi =\mu_o\frac{2\pi M_oa^3}{3}\int_{a\sin\theta}^{s}\frac{2z^2-s^2}{(s^2+z^2)^{5/2}}s'ds'$$

$$
\begin{align}
\int_{a\sin\theta}^{s}\frac{2z^2-s^2}{(s^2+z^2)^{5/2}}s'ds' & = \left[-\frac{2}{3}\frac{z^2}{(s^2+z^2)^{3/2}}+\frac{s^2+\frac{2}{3}z^2}{(s^2+z^2)^{3/2}}\right]_{a\sin\theta}^{s}\\
& =-\frac{2}{3}\frac{z^2}{(s^2+z^2)^{3/2}}+\frac{s^2+\frac{2}{3}z^2}{(s^2+z^2)^{3/2}}+\frac{2}{3}\frac{z^2}{(a^2\sin^2\theta+z^2)^{3/2}}-\frac{a^2\sin^2\theta+\frac{2}{3}z^2}{(a^2\sin^2\theta+z^2)^{3/2}}\\
& =-\frac{2}{3}\frac{z^2}{r^3}+\frac{s^2+\frac{2}{3}z^2}{r^3}+\frac{2}{3}\frac{z^2}{a^3}-\frac{a^2\sin^2\theta+\frac{2}{3}z^2}{a^3}\\
& =\frac{s^2}{r^3}-\frac{a^2\sin^2\theta}{a^3}
\end{align}
$$

where $a^2\sin^2\theta+z^2=a^2$ and $r^2=s^2+z^2$ was used.

and the line integral of $\mathbf{A}$ is the same as it was when the area was fully inside the sphere.

$$
\begin{align}
\int \mathbf{B}\boldsymbol{\cdot}d\mathbf{a} & = \frac{2}{3}\mu_oM_o\pi (a\sin\theta)^2 +  \mu_o\frac{2\pi M_oa^3}{3}\left[\frac{s^2}{r^3}-\frac{a^2\sin^2\theta}{a^3}\right]\\
& = \mu_o\frac{2\pi M_oa^3}{3}\frac{s^2}{r^3}\\
& = \mu_o\frac{2\pi M_oa^3}{3}\frac{\sin^2\theta}{r}
\end{align}
$$

Setting this equal to $\oint\mathbf{A}\cdot d\mathbf{l}=2\pi r\sin\theta A_{\phi}$ and solving for $A_{\phi o}$ gives

$$A_{\phi o}=\mu_o\frac{M_oa^2}{3}\frac{\sin\theta}{r^2}$$

Recall that this solution is only valid for $|z|\le a$. For $|z|\gt a$, the only contribution to the flux is from the magnetic field outside of the sphere: 

$$\int \mathbf{B}\boldsymbol{\cdot}d\mathbf{a}=\int_0^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{s}B_{zo}(s')s'ds'd\phi$$

Evaluation of this integral will give the same result as the flux integral for $|z|\le a$ and so the vector potential outside the sphere is the same and given by $A_{\phi o}$ found above.
