## Green function for infinite dome

In class, I showed how to find the potential $\psi$ due to a point charge inside of a grounded, conducting, and closed dome when the radius of the dome is infinite. The potential was found using the method of images. (A dome is a hemisphere plus a cap.) 

Use this $\psi$ and equation 1.35 of Jackson (or equation 1.42; $\psi$ is proportional to a Green function) to find the potential $\Phi$ for the following problem:

An conducting dome has its base in the $x-y$ plane and the radius of the dome is infinite. There are no charges inside of the dome. The boundary of the dome is grounded except for the region between $x^2 + y^2 < b$, which is held at a potential of $V_o$.

1. Find the potential $\Phi(z)$ inside of the dome (the integral required to find $\Phi(x,y,z)$ requires an approximation of the integrand or numerical integration and will be considered in the future).
2. Find the potential $\Phi(z)$ inside of the dome when $b/z \ll 1$. Do this by Taylor series expanding $\Phi(z)$ for small $b/z$. Does the answer make sense?
3. Sketch the electric field lines inside of the dome.

Note that a related problem (but with a different Green function) considered in 2.6 of Jackson.

## 2--D Cartesian Boundary Value Problem

Review Griffiths 3.3.1 (3rd and 4th edition). You should be able to quickly derive the potential for Figure 3.20 (3rd and 4th edition) when any one of the sides is at $V_o$ and the other three are grounded. See also [my PHYS 305 notes](https://rweigel.github.io/phys305/boundary_value_problems.html).

Suppose the sides of Figure 3.20 of Griffiths 3rd or 4th edition are held at $V_l$, $V_r$, $V_t$, and $V_b$, where $l=$left, $r=$right, $t=$top, and $b=$bottom. Find the potential inside the rectangular pipe.

Hints:

1. The total potential will be the the sum of the potentials from four different problems (1)
 $V_l$ non--zero and all other sides zero, (2) $V_r$ non--zero and all other sides zero, etc. I will ask you to explain why in class.
2. You can build the solution to three of the four problems described in the first hint using a transformation of coordinate system and the solution to one of the problems.

## 2--D Spherical Boundary Value Problem

In 2.7 of Jackson 3rd edition, he solves for the potential outside of a sphere with hemispheres held at $\pm V$ using a Green function. In example 3.7 of Griffiths 4th edition (example 3.6 in 3rd edition), he describes how to solve for the potential outside of a sphere with a potential of $V(\theta)$ on its surface. As a result, Jackson's example is related to Griffiths' example.

Study these two examples and be prepared to answer questions (such as how they are related) about them in class.
